3,Clarification On Trading Min Contracts With The New CBA,nba,"I'm just trying to get some clarity on the trading of min contracts. Here are the rules as I understand them:

1. Can't aggregate multiple min players together in a trade, (doesn't apply if the amount of contracts, not necessarily salary, incoming/outgoing are the same?)
2. Rule #1 doesn't apply if you are only trading min players, in which case you can trade 2 min players, (again doesn't apply if the amount of contracts, not necessarily salary, incoming/outgoing are the same?)
3. Neither Rule 1 nor Rule 2 apply between December 15th and the trade deadline, at which point you can trade as many as you want

Why have rules 1+2 if you are going to have rule 3? Why have rule 3 if you are going to have rules 1+2? Seems unnecessarily complicated. Am I reading this right?

For those that are wondering my source, it's [this article](https://theathletic.com/4607105/2023/06/28/nba-cba-new-rules/) in the Athletic that says: 

&gt; •	There will be a cap on how many minimum contracts can be thrown into a deal when that deal is done at any time except for Dec. 15 through the trade deadline. In deals outside that period, if a team is aggregating two or more salaries in a trade and getting at least one player back, and the number of contracts that team is sending out is more than the amount of players it is receiving in return, then that team cannot trade more than one minimum contract.

Magic is typically ranked 4th all time in rankings, from casual fan rankings to network rankings including in ESPN and The Athletic’s ranking, so having Curry &gt; Magic PG wise makes it appear that people have Curry around 4th all time, considering that Magic was that great as a player and his impact and legacy combined with his talent makes him usually the 4th ranked player. 

This begs the question to people who have Curry as the best PG of all time: would you rank him 4th in place of Magic all time and how does Position Ranking differ from All Time Ranking if you don’t have him higher than Magic all time?",t5_2qo4s,t3_15n22ps,0.23,False,1691641991.0

27,"Was the impact of handchecking ""real""? On the flipside, is it even really gone now?",nba,"People have always talked about how much harder it is back in the day because it was exponentially more physical, mainly due to the handchecking. Since I'm a Gen Z AND a super casual fan, my knowledge is obviously close to zero on this. However, I did try my best during my free time to watch some full 90's games on YouTube and other stuff, which isn't honestly that much since I've probably only seen like 15 so far. And no, I started gaining an interest in watching 90's ball before I tried to look for the handchecking things. Anyway, from what these old heads and former players say, they make it seem like the defenders were on the offensive player's jersey every time they're on-ball but I don't really see much beyond ""normal"" basketball? By normal I mean that the greater, if any, honestly, possession-by-possession physicality, especially the handchecking, isn't really that noticeable? Like when when Jordan hit the shot vs the Jazz, it wasn't really until he started making his move toward the defender did the latter only even touch MJ. With what I've heard, I expected something more like the defender being in Jordan's face with a few shoves here and there, but no, not really. I know that's only one example but that's like the highest stake possible, no? Another observation is that when they did handcheck the offensive player just kinda ""handshakes"" it a lot of the time by like doing backdown dribbles and shit. 

Yes, I did only watch 15 or so games, but a lot of those are playoff games and I honestly expected more. And yes, handchecking still exists today, and if the trend in what I'm watching continues, I would even conclude that it's still the same in today's NBA that's supposedly without handchecking.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15n0a94,0.7,False,1691636704.0

47,[O.C.] Who would have won Finals MVPs before 1969?,nba,"Possible someone has already done this here but I did a quick search &amp; couldn't find anything. I've always felt like the lack of Finals MVPs puts early players at a disadvantage when it comes to legacy conversation &amp; wanted to give them their due.

**1947 Philadelphia Warriors - Joe Fulks** We mostly only have PPG to go off of before 1955. Efficiency was very low across the league at this point but even by that standard the hall of famer Fulks was a massive shot chucker, going 4-20, 8-25 and 10-34 in games 2, 4 and 5. Fulks averaged 26.2 PPG while his second leading scorer averaged 11.4 so this really wasn't close.

**1948 Baltimore Bullets - Connie Simmons** How many of you NBA history buffs knew who Connie Simmons is? He never won any accolades while averaging 9.8 PPG for his career but the Bullets winning this series was a complete team effort &amp; Simmons was their best player, stepping up his play to put up 15.2 PPG on good efficiency for the time, while also finishing second in assists on his team. Guarantee he's the only Simmons who will ever have a Finals MVP

**1949 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** The league's first true superstar was in a class of his own at this point. Unfortunately we don't have shooting splits for every game but in two of three we do have Mikan went 14-21 and 13-20 which is out of this world for the time. He easily led both teams with 27.5 PPG and he's Mikan so he was probably averaging like 15 rebounds as well

**1950 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** Mikan upped his scoring to 32.2 this series while his team averaged just 84.5 putting this on the level of Jordan 1998. His efficiency did seem to drop off from 1949 outside of a brilliant 40 piece in game 6 but there's no doubt he was completely unstoppable

**1951 Rochester Royals - Arnie Risen** Congrats Kings fans, your team's best Finals player finally gets some recognition. They almost blew the series after going up 3-0 but the Royal's hall of fame big man was too much to overcome as he finished with averages of 21.7, 14.3 and 2.7

**1952 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** Mikan was no longer the scoring phenom of years past but he was still a fantastic all-around player putting up averages of 21.7, 17.4 and 2.4

**1953 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** For some reason they stopped tracking rebounds this series. All I know is that Mikan had 19 in game 4 but it's fairly safe to assume he was averaging his usual 15+. He also led his team in scoring once again with an inefficient 20.8 making this another easy choice.

**1954 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** The last of Mikan's 5 finals MVPs as he averaged 18.1 PPG, the only member of his team to get above 11. He added 13.1 rebounds per game for good measure. Man I wish we had more footage of this guy

**1955 Syracuse Nationals - Dolph Schayes** Led his team in both scoring and efficiency with totals of 19, 11.9 and 3. Not sure how it's possible to lead your team in efficiency shooting 39% but nevertheless he did it making him the easy choice

**1956 Philadelphia Warriors - Paul Arizin** ""Pitchin' Paul"" is one of the few players of his time who would maybe still be good nowadays as his statline of 27.6, 8 &amp; 2.8 on 43% from the field and 88% from the free throw line is still respectable. He had a wonky shooting form for sure but for the 1950's it was the smoothest jumper in the game.

**1957 Boston Celtics - Tom Heinsohn** To the surprise of absolutely nobody the legendary hall of famer who spent his entire career in Boston won Finals MVP in his rookie season, but maybe not the player you were expecting. Heinsohn averaged 24, 12.6 &amp; 2.1 on 40% shooting while Bob Cousy put up 20.7, 6.7 &amp; 9.1 on 32% shooting. You could go either way on this but at this point efficiency was rising and 32% was really ugly. Heinsohn also had one of the greatest game 7's in history putting up 37 and 23 on phenomenal efficiency while Cousy shot 2/20 yikes

**1958 Atlanta Hawks - Bob Pettit** You could make the case that Cliff Hagan was the Hawks' best player in the playoffs as a whole but for the finals Pettit stepped up when the team needed him putting up averages of 29.3, 17 &amp; 2.2 outpacing Hagan's 25.2, 9.7 &amp; 3.5. Like with the previous series the deciding game 6 was a major factor in determining this award and in that game Bob Pettit dropped 50 points and 19 rebounds, in a game the Hawks won by just 1.

**1959 Boston Celtics - Tom Heinsohn** Bill Russell set the all time record for rebounds per game in a finals series averaging a jaw-dropping 29.5 but at the end of the day you need to score the ball to win &amp; I just can't give Finals MVP to a guy who averaged a very inefficient 9.3 points per game. Once again Heinsohn was the team's best option as he led the team in both points and efficiency, putting up 24.3 on 48% shooting while pitching in a well-rounded 8.8 rebounds and 3 assists. When discussing all time greats from the early NBA nobody ever talks about Tom Heinsohn's legacy but I bet they would if he had 2 finals MVPs.

**1960 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** We're now getting into Russell's prime as he had developed into a solid offense player while still being the GOAT defender. For this series he averaged 16.7, 24.9 and 3 on solid efficiency and in typical Russell fashion he entered another level in game 7 putting up 22 points and 35 rebounds

**1961 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** Take the stats of the last series and pump them up a notch. Russell averaged 17.6, 28.8 and 4.4 although his efficiency dipped a bit. There is a case to be made for a late-career Finals MVP for Bob Cousy, who averaged 19.8, 5 &amp; 10.6 on about the same efficiency once you take free throws into account. However defensively Bill Russell is Bill Russell while Cousy was 32 at this point. 

**1962 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** One of the greatest finals series of all time. Russell averaged 22.9, 27 &amp; 5.7 on excellent efficiency while coming up huge in game 7 where he put up 30 points and 40 rebounds in a 3 point game. Were it not for that game I'd have to seriously consider the Lakers' Elgin Baylor who averaged 40.6, 17.9 &amp; 3.7 but Russell's game 7 makes this a no contest.

**1963 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** A step down from 1962 (duh), he still averaged 20, 26 &amp; 5.3 on good efficiency. 

**1964 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** This is the hardest choice of all of these. Russell had a down finals by his legendary standard averaging 11.2, 25.2 &amp; 5 while teammate Sam Jones put up an efficient 21.2, 4.4 &amp; 2.8. Jones was never known to be an elite defender but of course we don't have much footage of this series so I can't say for sure how much of a factor this was. Russell has the most well-rounded stats &amp; he played 10 more minutes per game than Jones so I want to say he'd get the award but 10 extra PPG on better efficiency is important. It's a tough call. 

**1965 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** So Bill Russell decided to shoot 70% from the field in this series. What a fascinating guy he was. You almost feel bad for the Lakers like what were they supposed to do about this? In total he averaged 17.8, 25 &amp; 5.8

**1966 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** Russell continued his high level of performance in this series averaging 23.6, 24.3 &amp; 3.7 on well over 50% shooting while coming up with 25 points and 32 rebounds in the 2-point game 7. This series puts him at 7 Finals MVPs to pass Jordan. Are we sure this guy isn't the GOAT? Wherever you rank him, his ability to come through in big moments is the biggest reason for his 11 championships and that's a quality you can't underestimate

**1967 Philadelphia 76ers - Wilt Chamberlain** We've finally reached Wilt, who had put up crazy statlines in losing efforts throughout the decade but he was only his team's 5th leading scorer this time. Still, 17.7, 28.5 &amp; 6.8 is a Finals MVP statline &amp; of the Sixers 5 17 PPG scorers he was easily the most efficient. Also it's Wilt so you know he was averaging like 9 BPG

**1968 Boston Celtics - John Havlicek** You could maybe go with Bill Russell yet again as he had a characteristic statline of 17.3, 21.8 &amp; 5.7 but unlike Sam Jones from 1964 Havlicek was another elite all around player so I have Russell losing this one off the difference in scoring. Hondo averaged 27.3, 8.7 &amp; 6.7 on similar efficiency while both players played averaged over 48 minutes per game on the series.

48,NBA Expansion/Conference Realignment,nba,"All signs point to Seattle and Las Vegas being the favorites to receive expansion franchises.  Adam Silver said they will focus on expansion after they close their next media right deals, which, ends in 2025.

Assuming Las Vegas and Seattle join the Western Conference, what team do you think would be the most logical to move to the Eastern Conference?

In my opinion, Memphis, New Orleans, and Minnesota make the most sense.

Also, does the NBA revamp the divisions with 16 teams in both conferences? Do they go back to two larger divisions or 4 4-Team divisions?

I played around with some things and like how this works geographically. Minnesota in the East here but you could swap in Memphis or New Orleans easily.

52,Where do you rank Luka's supporting cast in the West?,nba,"Mavs: Kyrie, GWilliams, Josh Green, Seth Curry, Tim Hardaway

Homers can debate about Hardy and Lively but they're both young or unproven players.

Nuggets: Murray, MPJ, Gordon, Braun (he's young but he has proven himself in the Nuggets' title run)

Grizzlies: Bane, JJJ, Adams, Smart

Kings: Sabonis or Fox (whoever you want to designate as the support player to the top player), Murray, Barnes

Suns: KD, Ayton, Beal, Gordon

Clippers: PG, Zubac, Westbrook, Powell, Mann (fluid situation, it could turn into Harden, PG and Zubac)

Warriors: Klay, Draymond, CP3, Wiggins

Lakers: AD, Rivers, DLo, Rui, Gabe Vincent

Wolves: assuming KAT is the top dog Ant, Gobert, McDaniels

The Mavs are easily 8th best, right? They're only ahead of the Clippers because of the health of PG. I'm not going to argue with you if you think the Clippers are better now or in the future if they get Harden.

Again, this is a comparison of the supporting players excluding the top dog. Luka makes such a big difference that if you include him, the Mavs will advance a few notches.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15muei4,0.61,False,1691621638.0

He would get really good tickets from his clients every once in awhile and I remember sitting close enough to the Blazers bench and I could see my favorite player of all time, Damon Stoudamire standing near the scorer's table (they were warming up still). My dad and I started yelling his name to get his attention but it was too loud in the stadium. Some folks sitting next to us noticed this and started to yell along with us. We eventually got Damon's attention and he turned around and gave us/me a headnod and a thumbs up. I'll never forget that moment. 

Right after that, a guy sitting next to us saw my excitement and claimed he had Patrick Ewing's (I think?) used armband from a game where he threw it at the crowd. He brought it out and let me see it. He then told me I could keep it. I couldn't believe it. 

Looking back on it, that's one of the best days of my life. I was maybe 8 or 9 and it was at an NBA basketball game with my dad. This is before tip-off. I think that's the magic behind sports and being a fan of the game. It's so much more than just basketball. It's the shared experience with the people we care about.

Pay each of these guys 30-40 million and at 120-160 total you would still have almost an entire second salary cap to fill out the rest of the roster with, allowing you to easily go 8-12 deep with pretty elite players. 

Assuming you can get most players within reason (not just combining every overly-valuable contract in the league, but actually paying guys what they are worth), how much depth would it take to overwhelm a team like the Nuggets who have to eventually give minutes to players like Braun and Cancar (no disrespect to them)? Could you build a contending team with no players in the top 40 or 50? Or do you think the top superstars would still outshine depth no matter what? ",t5_2qo4s,t3_15mrwcd,0.74,False,1691615976.0

74,The All-Star Game Can Be Legendary,nba,"Ever since last year when Luka was mic'd up for the first few possessions and just let defenders go right by him for 3 minutes while he did an in-game interview while playing, I have been on a mission to create a truly competitive ASG environment.   It's just such a shame to waste all that talent on the court at the same time.

 I went back and watched all the ASG highlights for the past 25 seasons.  I tried to find any time people were competitive and why they were competitive.  I looked for any type of format that may have worked better than the other.  I wanted to piece together and unlock the ultimate ASG format that creates Legends, not jokes.

And so I reveal, today, the best possible ASG format to create competitiveness IMHO.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Very important 1st rule: If you play in the ASG, then you are eligible for all End of Season Awards at 64 games played instead of 65
2. There is no more drafting or Captains, this actually removes competitiveness as it creates comfortability and familiarity for the top players.  **We want to leverage a sense of unease and chips on shoulders that comes from haphazard fan voting.**
3. The 5 players who get the most votes is Team 1. 
4. The next 5 players who got the next most votes is Team 2.  So on until 4 Teams is created.
5. *The 5th team is entirely created by the coaches.*
6. After the teams are created, the NBA has an Ad campaign featuring Team 1 as the greatest 5 man team in the world and who could possibly beat them?  Use the commercial to show some of the other players from other teams and ask ""Could the coaches team win it all this year?"" at the end.
7. Sunday Night ASG.  Team 1 takes the court vs Team 2.  There is no clock aside from shot clock.
8. All shots are 1 point.  Threes are worth 2 points.  
9. *First team to score 10 points stays on the court and plays the next Team.*  
10. Teams rotate in order while the winners always stay on the floor.
11. First team to total 50 points wins the ASG. 
12. The best player of the winning team gets the Kobe Bryant Trophy
13. The other players from the winning team get the Black Mamba Legends - Medallions that go around their neck, placed on each teammate by the MVP. 

Some notes about why this would raise competition

* This will be the first time in ASG history that the top 5 vote getters would play together, and all the other teams will want to take them down.  Having that kind of power in 1 starting lineup is extremely marketable as well. 
* Winners Stay rules.  Quite simple, you want to get ASG MVP? **You want to get play time? You have to win.  You aren't just given your minutes freely by the coach.** 
* The Teams 2/3/4 will have chips on shoulders.  The Coaches team will be extra motivated to prove themselves and force other teams to play hard or they will run the table. 
* The 5 on 5 setting and winners stays rule is extremely intimate, which breeds competitiveness. 
* Tons of media heads will eat up comparing these teams before they play. Speculation and clicks will be high creating more pressure for the players to perform well

I always see these but people don't understand the concept of the percentages. The percentages mean if I were to say this take is 20% then I mean I think like 80% of people would agree with me and 20% wouldn't. 

**10%:** Lebron and Jordan are the top 2 greatest basketball players of all time

**20%:** Nikola Jokic is the best player in ball and should of won MVP but didn't because they didn't want to give him 3 in a row

**30%:** Hakeem Olajuwon is the greatest defender of all time and is a top 3 center of all time

**40%:** Michael Jordan is the GOAT

**50%:** Jordan Poole will average 27+ PPG next season and not make the all star team similiar to Bradley Beal in 2020

**60%:** People are underrating how good the Rockets off season was. Everyone is calling the FA signings woeful but its simply not true. The FVV one is especially underrated and I expect the Rockets to have an 11 seed floor and a 6 seed ceiling. Around 35-45 wins

**70%:** Players who are not very efficient and their main attribute is their scoring who also play mid defense are the most overrated players and cannot play winning basketball (Carmelo Anthony)

**80%:** Russell Westbrook is not a winning basketball player and his stats were empty in his MVP season. I think he only won because of the narrative of a TD season. (Love Russ tho)

**90%:** I think stats are easily the best indicator of how good a basketball player is and I value it heavily over the eye test

90,Josh Giddey is awesome. He needs to change.,nba," The Thunder are weird.

Their ostensible point guard and alpha dog, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, scored more than 30 points per game by dancing through and around defenders. A flamenco for a finger-roll, a salsa for a slam. He’s also the rare true-blue star guard who doesn’t really shoot from deep, which imposes unusual roster-building rules upon Oklahoma City.

Ideally, a team’s secondary stars and role players should accentuate the main character. Rising sophomore Jalen Williams, likely OKC’s second-best player already, seems to be an easy fit next to anyone. Chet Holmgren hasn’t played an NBA minute yet, but the mouthwatering *idea* of him is as a shot-obliterating, flamethrowing stretch-five, both mitigating SGA’s weaknesses and enhancing his strengths. Lu Dort needs to hit more shots, but he certainly puts up enough threes (and his defense is killer).

That leaves Josh Giddey, the 6’8” 20-year-old from Australia. Giddey, as currently constructed, doesn’t quite make sense next to SGA. Defense and shooting are arguably the most critical attributes for non-superstars, and unfortunately, Giddey is the opposite of a 3-and-D player right now.

Despite what the narrative suggests, however, Giddey’s outside shot isn’t his only concern — when he gets close to the hoop, the bugbear bites. He hit 62% of his attempts at the rim last season, a respectable number for a typical 6’4” shooting guard but a mediocre mark for a 6’8” ox masquerading as a wing. He has no problem using his size to get to the paint but seems to shy away from contact at the last minute despite acceptable free throw percentages.

Giddey averaged a paltry 1.9 free throw attempts per game, a jarring number for someone [who shot 40% of their attempts at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/21/player#tab-shooting_frequency). With SGA averaging more than ten free throw attempts per game, there might not be a lot of freebies left over, but Giddey has to be more assertive in the paint.

Although he has a solid handle, a lack of first-step burst hampers Giddey. He often creates advantages at the top of the key or on the wing that he loses by the time he gets to the rim.

Another problem: shot selection. Giddey has a good floater game when he gets to the short midrange. That’s a weapon when used judiciously, but like oversalted pot roast, Giddey sprinkles it in a little too often. Giddey’s lack of athleticism and irrational fear of contested layups results in forced teardrops, dragging down his efficiency numbers.

But Giddey’s passing is sublime. He’s easily the best table-setter on the Thunder, and he’d be a league leader in assists if he were the primary ballhandler. Despite sharing the court with SGA, he assisted on 30% of his teammates’ made shots last season, a number on par with LeBron and Giannis. He can throw the ball with either hand and utilizes an unusual variety of velocities to trick defenders and set up teammates.

It’s easy to imagine that assist number rising if Holmgren, Williams, and other teammates can help space the floor more effectively; OKC was a below-average three-point shooting team in both frequency and accuracy, which was particularly true of the starting lineup. Better shooting means more room for Giddey’s beloved bounce passes.

Giddey’s wizardry with the ball is at its best on inbounds plays. His height gives him access to more angles than most inbounders, and his daring opens up passing lanes nobody else would try. The Thunder love to run a play springing Shai free for a cut from the top of the arc to the hoop as Giddey mischievously throws it right behind an unaware defender's butt (see link in comments for an example).

Giddey is also an exceptional rebounder on both ends for his size — he has a better offensive rebounding rate than Joel Embiid and a better defensive rebounding rate than Mitchell Robinson. The defensive rebounds, in particular, are key, as they let him grab the ball and immediately push up the floor, where he’s a beast in transition.

Giddey’s defense will always be somewhat problematic. He’s 6’8” with T-rex arms, and the lack of horizontal and vertical burst limits his effectiveness both in space and at the rim. There are times when he'll contest a dunk, but he can barely even get off the ground before the ball is rattling through the hoop.

 At least Giddey doesn’t make many “business decisions” to get out of the way. He does try hard on defense, which matters, and he’s generally in the right spots at the right time. He rarely fouls, and like most great passers, Giddey can use his vision to anticipate the other team’s ball movement to get steals and deflections. He doesn’t so much jump passing lanes as lurk in them, crocodilian eyes peering out while he waits, submerged, for a foolish mistake (link in comments).

When watching Thunder games, it feels like he’s involved in more defensive plays than the numbers show. Giddey will never be a great defender, but just being big and smart is enough to ensure a baseline level of not-terribleness. He should become acceptably mediocre.

Acceptably mediocre would be a boon to his outside shot. A lot hinges on him further developing his three-point jumper. Before last season, the Thunder hired legendary shooting coach Chip Engelland away from the Spurs (and gave him a nice promotion to assistant coach). Giddey reaped the benefits. Last year’s 32.5% (on 3.1 attempts per game) doesn’t sound great on paper, but it’s a noteworthy step up from his rookie year’s 26.3% mark.

For what it’s worth, Giddey shoots it confidently, and his improvement was encouraging. Giddey doesn’t need to be a knockdown shooter, but like his defense, getting to average-ish would greatly benefit others and himself. Nearly all of Giddey’s threes were assisted; if he could become more comfortable creating one for himself, it would mitigate his lack of an initial first step and open up more driving lanes. It would also go a long way toward improving his partnership with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

I’ve been sitting here side-eyeing the pachyderm in the room while describing Giddey’s game, but the elephant is getting restless. Here’s the fundamental question that will change the direction of the Oklahoma City Thunder for the next half-decade: can Giddey and SGA play together?

This isn’t new; [I talked about it ](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/weekly-hodgepodge-deep-fakes-are)at the beginning of last year, when the answer sure looked like a resounding “no.” As of Nov 10, 2022:

* Shai w/o Giddey: +17 points per 100 possessions; 97th percentile
* Giddey w/o Shai: -12 points per 100 possessions, 7th percentile
* Both together: -16 points per 100 possessions, -infinity percentile

It was brutal! But things smoothed out as the season went on. Full-season numbers (from Cleaning the Glass) paint a slightly different picture:

* Shai w/o Giddey: +7.3 points per 100 possessions
* Giddey w/o Shai: -4.4 points per 100 possessions.
* Both together: -1.3 points per 100 possessions.

Giddey’s passing is an essential part of OKC’s offense, but it’s hard to ignore how much better the team was with him off the floor — Giddey had [the worst on/off point differential](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/21/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) of any big-minute Thunder player.

Shai got better at cutting off Giddey’s playmaking, and the team got more thoughtful about putting Giddey in spots that wouldn’t cramp SGA’s jagged drives. And the team heavily staggered Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander to ensure each got time to drive the bus.

But SGA is the engine, chassis, drivetrain, and bespoke paint job of the Thunder’s offense. For four straight years, the team has been unable to score whenever SGA is off the court, and Giddey’s passing talents haven’t been able to change that.

Improvement from the Thunder’s surrounding cast will make a big difference, particularly if Holmgren and young forward Jalen Williams can make an impact with three-point shooting.

But a -1.3 net rating isn’t good. When Giddey’s defender ignores him, Giddey needs to do *something.* A cut, a relocation along the perimeter, an off-ball screen (Draymond Green can be the inspiration here), anything to punish the defense’s temerity. 

Giddey improved at this as the season went along, and grew particularly adept at timing his cuts from the corner to the basket as Shai wove into the lane. But there's still room for growth.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the Thunder’s Moses. If they are to escape the desert, he must be the guide. It falls to everyone else to adjust their games to his idiosyncratic style. To become a part of the Thunder’s future, Giddey needs to change. He must stop settling for floaters, finish stronger, defend better, and become an outside threat.

That sounds like a lot, but let’s not forget: despite having two full seasons under his belt, Giddey can’t even order a [Great Northern](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/drink/australias-top-selling-beers-for-2022-revealed/news-story/96e0a16f27a39c0d821cb1a62f419590) for another two months. He showed substantial improvement across the board from his rookie to his sophomore season, and there are plenty of reasons to think he'll continue along the upward track. He shot 48% from the field overall in his second year, a massive improvement from the 42% he hit as a rookie.

Most of the things he struggles with can be developed. The Thunder can afford to be patient for another year to see his progress.

I am high on both Giddey and the potential of the Thunder’s core. I believe that Giddey’s exemplary passing is something every team needs, and although it hasn’t shown in the numbers yet, it should have a cascading positive effect on the offense.

But SGA is in his prime right now, and OKC has a bevy of assets for any team shopping the next disgruntled star. For all his talent, Giddey will never be the lab-grown perfect running mate next to Gilgeous-Alexander. If they can’t develop better chemistry sooner rather than later, Giddey might be packing up his hair products and moving elsewhere in 2024.

94,How would you build Team USA this year if you had to abide by the salary cap?,nba,"This was just a thought I had the other night, as I was hearing people talk about how ""bad"" the roster is for Team USA in the World Cup, but everyone on the roster is still basically a top-3 player on their own team. So, if you had to build an actual team with the NBA salary cap rules, with like actual ""backup"" level players on the team, what would it look like?

Here are the rules: Use salaries for the upcoming 2024 season. The salary cap for this year is going to be $136.021 million. The first apron level is $172.346 million, the second apron level is $182.794 million. If you go past the $136.021 million mark, you can go up to the second apron, but you have to use players that were signed using ""exceptions"" this year (midlevel, biannual, minimum, etc.) beyond that. You cannot go past the second apron.

Any G-League, college, or American players in international leagues will count as the minimum salary, which we're just going to round to $1 million. (If it helps, to stay under the salary cap, you'd need each player to average $11.3 million. To stay under the second apron, it'd need to average $15.2 million.)

For reference, here's what the current team makes:

* Paolo Banchero, Forward, Orlando Magic, $11.6 million
* Mikal Bridges, Forward, Brooklyn Nets, $21.7 million
* Jalen Brunson, Guard, New York Knicks, $26.3 million
* Anthony Edwards, Guard, Minnesota Timberwolves, $13.5 million
* Tyrese Haliburton, Guard, Indiana Pacers, $5.8 million
* Josh Hart, Guard, New York Knicks, $12.9 million
* Brandon Ingram, Forward, New Orleans Pelicans, $33.8 million
* Jaren Jackson Jr., Center, Memphis Grizzlies, $27.1 million
* Cam Johnson, Forward, Brooklyn Nets, $25.6 million
* Walker Kessler, Center, Utah Jazz, $2.8 million
* Bobby Portis, Forward, Milwaukee Bucks, $11.7 million
* Austin Reaves, Guard, Los Angeles Lakers, $12.0 million

Team total: $204.8 million (so some cuts/replacements would need to be made.)

A quick glance at the other [rosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup_squads) in the tournament looks like everyone else would definitely be under at least the second apron. Canada looks like it might be closest, but it doesn't look like the roster has been finalized, and I didn't feel like doing the math on it yet. ([Here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html) are the current salaries for quick reference.)

Does anyone really love those?",nba,"Without fail, the majority of interviews ask the """"Give me your top 5 all-time ...."" in the lightning round/rapid fire part and I don't understand why.  It's a lose-lose in every scenario I think can think of, if anyone likes it , I'd like to hear the appeal

1) **It's boring** \- it's a question that every single talking head debates, which, ironically , is what we hate about the talking head rhetoric the made us turn to the Player content instead.  And the concsensus is generally the same. Best shooters? Steph, Ray, Reggie, KD.  Best 2 guards ? MJ, Kobe, DWade, AI.  GOAT?  MJ, LeBron, Kareem, Russell.   The lists are ALWAYS within 80% identical.  So I don't understand what the appeal of hearing an NBA player say the exact same people that the whole world has.  

2) **It gets a Corporate response with no Value**\- Players respect other players for the most part, so they know that negativity/shade/ or omissions on their list has potential to blowback on them.  ""Hey, Give me your top 5 Power forwards"" .. ""Well, me personally, I think Karl Malone is a piece of shit, but hey..basketball stats!"".  I understand the balance between keeping it in basketball terms, but then why not just anybody with access to basketball reference....The Point of knowing an NBA players opinion is for the interesting/sometimes bias answer that comes with being in the Association.  ""Hey, Tim Duncan  is best all time, but I have him at 3 because he spit on my kid when I wasn't looking"".

I genuinely don't understand why this question is asked, especially from an NBA player, to an NBA player.  Is the thought that people want to hear this?  Id argue that in any casual or serious NBA discussion, the ""what ur top X question rarely comes up"".  Personally, I always love when ppl ask ""What was your welcome to the NBA moment?.  When did you know it was time to retire?  Who was someone that didn't get the love they deserve?  Who did you pattern your game after growing up?   Those stories are always entertaining and very personal, which is what we want from an inside players perspective. Take a page from Hot Ones on how to answer interesting and unique questions.

What do yall think?

TL;DR - Stop asking ""Who is your top 5 XXXX player"" in NBA Player Podcasts. It's boring, provides no value, is generic, and wastes the advantage of asking an NBA players their experience.

I’m 19 from eastern Canada, (Newfoundland) and I’ve been a basketball fan most of my life, and one thing I’ve noticed in my community is that there aren’t as many raptors fans as you’d think. 

Where I’m from you see a lot of Habs, maple leafs, bruins, Red wings and Blackhawks fans with a scatter oilers fan. 

On the basketball side of it tho all the old heads are raptors fans since they came to the nba, but the younger generation don’t support the raptors as much, it seems that with all my friends, family, etc, the more casual nba fans are raptors fans and the diehard nba fans go for the team they’re favourite player is on. There are a few Celtics fans, laker fans, some bulls fans from the Derrick Rose era, okc fans and nuggets fans.

Me personally I’ve always liked the lakers, I started watching the nba when I was around 10 and though Kobe was on the last few years of his career, the lakers were always the only other team on tv besides the raptors.

124,What Are Some of the Worst *Non-2016* Free Agency Signings in NBA History?,nba,"At this point, it's pretty well known and often discussed how bad much of the signings were for the 2016 offseason.  Part of that can be blamed on the massive spike in cap space but regardless, we saw a lot of awful signings that year.  Joakin Noah, Luol Deng, Nic Batum, Timofey Mozgov and Bismack Biyombo are but a few of the players we saw sign contracts for lifechanging money, even if the contracts themselves aged like milk left out in the sun.

But we're not here to talk about those signings.  We're here to talk about some of the all-time worst free agency signings outside of that infamous year.  Which ones come to mind?  

Off the top of my head, here are some of the more infamous options out there:

**Eddy Curry - $60M, 6 year contract (2005)**

Eddy Curry was sort of the precursor to Andrea Bargnani, in that he was a 7 foot center who couldn't rebound and wasn't a good defender; Curry's rebounding career high was a whopping 7 per game.  He wasn't a good shooter, his later years were marred by injury and general health issues - in his final 2 seasons with the Knicks he played **a total of 10 games** \- and yet, the start of his Knicks tenure was punctuated by a fairly substantial contract for 2005, the reasons for which that are still being studied to this day.  10M AAV back in the day when contracts could go as long as 6 years?  This is a classic ""Dolan is interfering with decision-making"" bad contract and it probably won't be the last one to pop up on this list.

Did I mention this also doubles as a classic bad Knicks trade?  Because the Knicks actually gave up assets to get Eddy via a sign and trade.

**Davis Bertans - $80M, 5 year contract (2021)**

You know what the Wizards are really good at?  Making the most out of bad contracts.  They were able to flip Davis Bertans and Spencer Dinwiddie into Kristaps Porzingus, a borderline All-Star that would net them Tyus Jones in a future trade when Tingus Pingus could have left them for nothing.  Not too shabby.  They even got a pick out of the affair!

You know who gave Davis Bertans that awful contract?  The Washington Wizards.  Probably the most recent example of a classic bad contract, Bertans was a shooter who, prior to his signing was shooting an efficient 52/41/85 on around 5 3s a game.  Sure he wasn't the best defender but he was a reliable threat from outside that helped space the floor and take some of the offensive load off Beal...

...then the 2021/22 season happened and he seemingly forgot how to shoot.  A drastic decrease in shooting to sub-36% from beyond the arc and and equally shocking drop in field goal percentage to less than 39%, the fact that Washington was able to get anything from Bertans is astonishing in its own right.  He was later dumped on the Thunder so they could move up to acquire Cason Wallace and while it's been a long time coming, this is a bad contract that will soon be off the books as his 2024/25 season has an early termination option that whomever team's he's ending up on will almost certainly take.  

$5 million is substantially less than $16 million, after all.

 **Juwan Howard - $115M, 7 year contract (1996)**

You're not going to see too many older contracts on this list and probaly even fewer in the comments section.  That's for a couple of reasons, most of which pertain to the politics of the league in its earlier days, the wacky length rookie players could be signed to before becoming unrestricted free agents rather than the 4 + QO/""whenever their extension ends or they force their way to another team"" of today, and the deck being heavily stacked in favor of ownership retaining players due to the rules at the time being best described as ""endless restricted free agency"".  A lot of that changed in the 90s and while leaving teams had a lot of stigma against it, players like Shaq jumped teams to get paid what they were worth after the team that drafted them lowballed them in free agency.

Juwan Howard...did not change teams...sort of, we'll get to the mess that happened with the signing itself, and technically his team's name did change as the Washington Bullets were renamed the Wizards later on, but in 1996 he was an unrestricted free agent and, coming off of an All-Star season where he got a 3rd Team nod, Howard was looking to get paid.  And paid he was!  

At around 16.4M AAV and locked in for 7 years, Howard peaked in his sophomore season but he wasn't bad necessarily.  He just...never became more than what he could have, and he wasn't pulling a bad team consistently into the playoffs; their peak was getting swept by the 1997 Bulls as the 8th seed.  He was your classic ""good stats, bad team"" player and though he never accomplished much as a Wizard, he can at least call himself an NBA champion as he rode the bench to a repeat via the Heatles.  The man had an absurdly long career even if he himself wasn't particularly successful but with 2 rings and a historic career earning (we'll get into that in a minute), I doubt he very much cares what you or I think of him.

The main reason why he's worth mentioning is that he was technically the first player to sign the largest contract in NBA history up to that point; the first contract in NBA history to go over $100 million, it was a contract that the Bullets/Wizards could have decided to not get into a bidding war with the Heat who offered him a more lucrative contract, albeit one that stirred some controversy at the time and that the league itself nullified due to cap rules at the time and some mishaps regarding bonuses to Tim Hardaway and P.J. Brown.  Also Alonzo Mourning had an extension at around the same time which is a part of this debacle.  The whole saga is a lot more interesting than the contract itself and it's worth a Google if you're curious about it; I didn't even touch on how Washington eventually re-signed Howard and all the implications said signing had at the time.  

This went to court.  No really, lawyers got involved.

Over who could sign Juwan Howard.

It was weird.

**Amar’e Stoudemire - $100M, 5 year contract (2010)**

Another classic bad Knicks contract though this one isn't entirely fair to New York because Stoudemire was excellent in his first year in the Garden.  25/8/2, Amar'e was still his All-Star self and even helped the team make the playoffs for the first time since 2004!  

The rest of that contract's duration?  Injuries in the later years, the loss of the late acquisition of Chauncey Billups from the prior season and an iso-heavy offense running through Melo did not do Stoudemire any favors, and did I mention the injuries?  This honestly wouldn't have been such a bad signing were it not for them but it's not like the Knicks were unaware that Amar'e could be a risky signing due to injury given some of the wear and tear from his days in Phoenix; he already had two  major surgeries on different parts of his body up to that point and his knees had the fortitude of a wet chip.

Amar'e is one of the most influential 4s of the modern era and he was integral to the revolutionary 7SoL Suns but his stint with the Knicks started out hot and cooled off very quickly.  Yet another unfortunate case where injuries robbed a truly special talent of what could have been an even more impactful and lengthy career.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15m63md,0.88,False,1691559382.0

126,Was Michael Jordan’s defense and off-ball play also legendary?,nba,"I watched The Last Dance not too long ago, and recent discussions of fantastic &amp; terrible off-ball players (Steph Curry vs Trae Young), with Trae Young’s lack of defensive effort and prowess specifically being highlighted in addition to his off-ball deficiencies got me thinking.

As someone who was born and raised far past the era of MJ’s Bulls, all I really have as a reference point in regards to his basketball ability is how driven, consistently clutch, and athletically gifted he was. 

These traits most obviously translate to dominant scoring and playmaking. As a result, that’s what retrospectives such as The Last Dance tend to focus most on.

I don’t hear too much about his defensive skills, and he’s infamous for always being “the guy” with the ball in his hand. He’s always taking the last shot. That’s what the casual mainstream level of media coverage pushes in my experience, at least.

So I’m really curious, to anyone who was fortunate enough to be around during his prime, or someone with far more extensive knowledge than myself, was Jordan so well rounded to the point that even his defensive game &amp; off-ball play could qualify as the “best” in their respective categories? Do we not hear much about it because moving past screens &amp; well timed assists aren’t as sexy as dunks and buzzer beating jump shots? Or was he just mediocre in those areas, but so talented offensively it can’t be knocked too hard as a flaw? Like was he the reverse Ben Wallace?",t5_2qo4s,t3_15m4ry0,0.74,False,1691555260.0

For example if we took all the 6'6+ D1 Players in NCAA, how many of them make it pro somewhere in the world?

Well looking at the research: https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2015/3/6/estimated-probability-of-competing-in-professional-athletics.aspx

53% of D1 men's basketball players ended up playing pro the year after they left college. When just looking at college basketball overall, it drops to 21% played pro the next year.

Off the top of my head from recent memory + being a Laker fan, both the Grizzlies and Warriors series this past year were very exciting to watch with many storylines. I’m sure there’s ONE definite answer I can’t think of right now but what do ya’ll think.

131,Was Michael Jordan really 6'6 ?,nba,"Hi Everyone I recently discovered that Michael Jordan despite being listed at 6'6 is actually 6'4 3/4

I was watching old MJ highlights and this one video against Boston Celtics MJ walked by the late Reggie Lewis , and Reggie seemed taller then Mj....Reggie is listed as 6'5.

Then I searched google  and it states that Pat Riley once said

""Did you know that when Jordan was measured he was only 6-4 and a half, not 6-6 the way he's listed"". Jordan was officially measured at 6′4 3/4 by the US Olympics team. And he looks about the same height as Charles Barkley, who he admitted himself, in his book, to standing 6′4 3/4″.

Then I asked google to show me some images of MJ and Charles Barkley side by side and yea they are both the same height with the eye test ?

Is this one of basketballs craziest conspiracies or what ?

I tried linking pictures with MJ and Charles but Reddit would not allow it for some reason.

Every single picture of him taken since December 30, 1984.

Video recordings do not count. Screenshots of screen recordings do not count.

For me:

Just my thoughts. 

With 82 games a year (without playoffs), and let’s say 20,000 fans per game, let’s say everyone and their toddler takes 10 pics of Lebron.

James Harden is an analogy I like to use, not because they’re all that similar in either talent or playstyle, but the parts of their game that are glorified and criticized are polar opposite. 

With Harden it’s “he’s a chucker”, with Kobe it’s “killer instinct”. With Harden his foul baiting is “terrible for the sport” but with Kobe the rip through was “a high IQ play”. I’m not saying either side is right or wrong, but it pisses me off that it’s so inconsistent.

194,Luke Kennard Quietly Had One of the Best Shooting Seasons Ever. Can He Break the Record?,nba,"Last season Luke Kennard shot 49% from three, which grades as the ninth best three-point shooting performance of all time (shooting more threes per game than anyone above him too). However, what's even more intriguing is his production as a Grizzly. Once joining the Grizzlies, Kennard shot 5.7 threes a game and made 54% of them. This would have been statistically the best shooting performance of all time. While it was only 24 games, Coach Jenkins heavily stressed that he wants him shooting more than he ever has in his career and made it a point to draw up plays for him. 

After leading the NBA in 3pt% the past two seasons, what are the chances he can break the record officially? The current holder is Kyle Korver with 53.6% on 2.1 attempts per game. He's already proven he can sustain 54% on nearly 6 attempts a game, now he's just gotta do it for a full season. Breaking this record would solidify Kennard as one of the greatest shooters ever, and really get him some recognition as I believe he's been overlooked for the majority of his career. 

**Why he can do it:** With the green light from coach, the spacing with another elite shooter in Bane (2nd best 3pt% in 2021-22), and the facilitating from Ja, I think it's in the realm of possibility. When Ja is on the court, he can draw double teams and pull defenders closer to the basket, opening up opportunities for Luke. I also think Steven Adams being the best offensive rebounder in the league helps a lot with second chance open threes. 

**Why he can't:** Kyle Korver had the benefit of only shooting two threes a game and only played in 54 games the season he set the record. Luke shooting six a game and playing 82 games is already a massive disadvantage due to the sustainability and volume that could have an effect on his shooting. Steph Curry is widely considered the greatest shooter of all time and he's never even shot 46% due to volume. Luke's best chance at breaking a record like this is taking less shots which would be detrimental to his team.

At the end of the day, we haven't seen shooting this accurate since 2009, and this is on a much higher volume. Shooting 54% from three for a team in a season to my knowledge has never been done, so what he did as a Grizzly last year is already incredibly special. From all the stats I can find, nobody has shot as accurate as Kennard on 4.6+ three attempts a game **ever**. We are witnessing an all-time shooting performance and it's going pretty under the radar.

If he doesn't land a job, it'll end one of the most impactful, underrated, infuriating, and misunderstood careers of his generation.",nba,"Now 34 years old, Blake Griffin is having trouble landing a job in free agency. If he does sign somewhere, it'll likely be in a reserve role. Last season for the Celtics, he played a total of 569 minutes in the regular season and only 6 minutes in the playoffs.

If Griffin's career ends with a whimper or a blurb buried at the bottom of ESPN, it'll be understating the impact of a player who had a major (albeit brief) influence on the league.

---


######**PART ONE: Instant Impact On the Court**

Playing for his local University of Oklahoma, Blake Griffin had a strong freshman year. He averaged 14.7 points (on 56.8% from the field) and 9.1 rebounds. The consensus from NBA scouts was that Griffin was a likely top lottery pick, and could have presumably climbed into the top 5-6 with strong workouts. 

However, Griffin must have felt there was still some work to do and still some upside on the table. He wasn't getting quite the national attention or draft respect he thought he may deserve, so he made the unconventional decision to return to college for his sophomore year. And there, Griffin removed all doubts that he had star potential. He put up monster numbers (22.7 points, 14.4 rebounds) and led the Sooners to a 30-6 record and an Elite Eight appearance. He was named the National Player of the Year and became the obvious # 1 pick in the draft.

Griffin got injured and missed his first year for the L.A. Clippers, setting up a highly-anticipated ""rookie"" season the following year. Griffin delivered -- and then some. That first year, Griffin averaged 22.5 points, 12.1 rebounds (a career high), and 3.8 assists. He was not only named as the easy ""Rookie of the Year,"" but he actually made the All-Star team and got on an MVP ballot -- finishing 10th overall.

Based on stats and accolades alone, you can argue that Blake Griffin had the best rookie season of the 2000s and perhaps the best since Tim Duncan.

---

######**PART TWO: Instant Impact Off the Court**

More impressive still, Blake Griffin did all that for the *Clippers*. It may be hard for younger NBA fans to understand how rotten the franchise had been at the time. The name ""Clippers"" was synonymous with ""sucks ass."" Since re-branding as the Clippers in 1978, the franchise made the playoffs 4 times. In 32 years. They were run by the deplorable and racist owner Donald Sterling, whose stink rotted the entire organization. At the time, the Clippers were the worst brand in the NBA.

That really did change with the arrival and optimism of Blake Griffin's prowess. Griffin became a star, and the fortunes turned for the franchise. The next year, the team traded for Chris Paul. Presumably, Paul wouldn't have agreed to join the team without a promising talent like Griffin on the roster. Two years later, the team hired Doc Rivers, whose stock was at an all-time high after his successful run with the Boston Celtics. Again, the idea that the *Clippers* could lure in a star coach would have been unthinkable a few years prior.

Thanks to Griffin (and Chris Paul, whose statistical impact can't be over-stated either), the Clippers went on an unprecedented run of success for the franchise. They won 50+ games five years in a row. And while that didn't result in an NBA Finals appearance, it did change the perception about the franchise. That only cemented a few years later, when Sterling was forced out and Steve Ballmer jumped in to provide stability (and deep pockets) to the team.

Right now, you'd put the Clippers into the ""glamor market"" tier -- a place where superstars may actually want to play. There are a variety of reasons why, but Blake Griffin's initial success did set the table for a lot of it. For that reason, his career goes behind numbers and W-L records and ranks as one of the most impactful in the broader NBA landscape.

---

######**PART THREE: An Underrated Skill Set**

When I suggest that Blake Griffin's career may be misunderstood or underrated, it's in regard to his actual basketball skill. There's a perception that Griffin came into the league as an ""athlete."" A dunker. In fact, his most defining basketball moment may have been his [Dunk Contest](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/blake-griffin-soars-over-car-to-win-slam-dunk-contest) win. And then, when he started to suffer injuries, he started to evolve his game to fit his declining athleticism.

That's not wholly true. The truth is, Griffin was *always* an underrated playmaker. He had great handles for his size and position and a good passing instinct. That's illustrated by his 3.8 assists as a rookie -- but also during the times when he was allowed to fully showcase his skill set.

When Chris Paul came to the team (in Griffin's second year) and took over the primary ballhandling duties, Griffin didn't always get the opportunity to show his full ""bag."" When he did take that alpha dog role, he shined. In 2013-14, CP3 missed 20 games due to injury, and Griffin responded with a career year and finished 3rd in MVP voting. 

We also saw that play out in 2018-19 after Griffin had lost a step and ended up in Detroit. It's largely a forgotten period in his career, but Griffin did have a brief standout stretch for the Pistons. That season, he averaged 24.5 points and 5.4 assists and helped a mediocre Detroit team make the playoffs.

These numbers -- a big averaging 4/5/6 assists -- don't really jump off the page in the modern NBA where we can see Nikola Jokic putting up 30/10/10 every night -- but they represent one of the better playmaking numbers for the PF position during that era.

---

######**PART FOUR: A Whole Bunch of Hypotheticals**

While Blake Griffin had a great NBA career and a good amount of team success with the Clippers, you can't help but wonder if they could have done more as a group together. ""What if?""

Maybe the team simply wasn't good enough. Maybe they'd never have won a title. But you can squint and see potential room for improvement from the club.

A lot of that is injury related, but I would say some of it was due to human error as well. The Clippers had a well-rounded starting four -- PG Chris Paul, SG J.J. Redick, PF Blake Griffin, and C DeAndre Jordan -- with an obvious hole in the middle at SF. It's a riddle that they were never quite able to solve as Matt Barnes started to age and decline.

The Clippers had some chances to fill it, but didn't take advantage. They cut Joe Ingles in training camp -- a heady well-rounded player that would have fit perfectly. They marginalized and traded a young Reggie Bullock -- another player who could have fit well as a 3+D wing.

Instead of taking a chance and developing young talent, Doc Rivers (as he's inclined to do) tapped the well of overrated and over-aged players instead. In Rivers' first year on the job as the coach and primary GM, he brought in a slew of over-the-hill veterans: Danny Granger (who was cooked by then), Big Baby Davis (same), Hedo Turkoglu (age 34), Stephen Jackson (age 35), and Antawn Jamison (age 37). All five of those players were out of the league by the end of the following year.

Rather than learn his lesson, Rivers kept striking out instead. He made the wrong choice repeatedly, falling back on old loyalties and biases rather than what was plainly in front of him. He over-played (and overpaid) his own son Austin Rivers as a result of that. But perhaps the epitome of Rivers' front office failures was the Clippers decision to bring in Paul Pierce (then age 38) at the tail end of his career. Sadly, it wasn't with the intention of using Pierce as a veteran mentor: it was with the intention of playing him minutes. At that age, Pierce wasn't up to the task. He shot 36.3% from the field and looked unplayable. Rather than realize that, Rivers started Pierce for 38 games. Somehow, the Clippers still won 51 games that year.

You do wonder what the Clippers could have been if they had a more competent coach in charge (or at least, had taken away Doc Rivers' personnel power earlier). 

---

######**PART FIVE: Cruel Fate and Cruel Fists** 

It'd be incomplete to write about Blake Griffin's career and not mention the long list of injuries that's plagued him throughout. We can't blame that on Doc Rivers. 

(Well, maybe we can, if you factor in that the Clippers overplayed Griffin early in his career. Like Zion Williamson, he's a power player who plays with a lot of intensity, and requires a lighter touch than other stars).

Still, Griffin got hurt a lot and that may have been bound to happen regardless. We can also blame him specifically for the injury when he fractured his hand after punching a trainer.

There's also some ""inevitability"" to Griffin's limited career when you consider his body type. He's a thick guy, but he has a limited wingspan (at 6'11""). When you're not very long, you're going to be limited as a shot blocker regardless of your athleticism. We saw that play out in his NBA career -- where he's only averaged 0.5 blocks per game -- and we're seeing that play out with Zion Williamson in New Orleans now. 

If Griffin was a little taller or longer, teams would have been able to play him more often as a smallball ""big"" (which they probably should have done anyway). The one area where Griffin did adjust his game to fit his declining athleticism was by shooting more threes -- and he did that reasonably well -- but he couldn't overcome his lack of length in the same way. (He also got better at comedy!, going from a little overexposed early to solid comedic performer at the Comedy Central roasts).

######**TL; DR**

Overall, it'll be interesting to see how history remembers the career of Blake Griffin (if this is indeed the end for him). As mentioned, he had an oversized impact for his franchise early on, then eventually got derailed by injuries.

In terms of basketball, is he going to be a Hall of Famer? That's TBD. He's a six-time All-Star, but never made the Finals and never won MVP. Basketball-reference lists his Hall of Fame probability at 54.8%, which may be optimistic.

Still, I'd maintain that Blake Griffin had one of the most impactful, underrated, misunderstood, and infuriating careers in our era for a variety of reasons.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15lm16f,0.93,False,1691509951.0

Where hoop dreams awaken and fortunes are spread,  
Where giants play magic with rock and with net,  
Where rivalries flourish with fires so hot.  
  
A is for Antetokounmpo, Greek Freak’s domain,  
With wingspan so vast, soaring through every lane,  
Offensive arsenal, finesse through each move,  
A force on the court, making opponents approve.  
  
B is for Bron James, a true basketball god,  
Enduring and charming, his dominance odd,  
The Lakers stand tall with his leadership grand,  
A team built for triumph, led by a man so grand.  
  
C is for Curry, the wizard of threes,  
With shots beyond range, he can bring a team to its knees,  
The Warriors in battle, with splash brothers by side,  
Unleashing a fury, where defenders collide.  
  
Beneath the bright lights, where Knicks proudly boast,  
A storied franchise that history can’t ghost,  
From Clyde to Ewing, the legends endure,  
Loyal fans chant, hoping for a breakthrough.  
  
In purple and gold, the Lakers shine bright,  
Borrowing stardust from the celestial height,  
With Magic and Kobe, and Shaq's mighty form,  
A tradition of triumph that can weather any storm.  
  
From the home of the Heat, where sun's rays embrace,  
Where Wade danced with the ball, leaving defenders in chase,  
The Miami’s red and black, as fierce as the sea,  
Fighting and striving for a place in history.  
  
In Raptor's true land, there's a tale yet untold,  
From underdog's shadow to shining of gold,  
Toronto’s finest soar with Raptors' might,  
VanVleet and Lowry, staying up all night.  
  
In Boston, the Celtics, a storied brigade,  
Where champions dance, in green jerseys they wade,  
From Russell to Bird, and Pierce in his prime,  
Legends forever, in basketball’s shrine.  
  
Through D.C. streets, the Wizards enchant,  
With Wall and Beal, casting spells through each chant,  
Washington’s hopes, forever emerging,  
Dreaming of glory, and they keep on surging.  
  
From Motor City's heart in the depths of the grind,  
The Pistons compete, leaving no steal behind,  
Led by Isiah Thomas, a legend of grit,  
Their dream for a title, can’t be called a misfit.  
  
In arenas that roar, with thousands in cheer,  
Where dreams find fulfillment, or melt into tears,  
The NBA where talents collide,  
A symphony of skills, celebrated worldwide.

He is very bad at the whole ""running a company"" thing, exemplified by his tumultuous tenure of meddling, firings and so on with Twitter, to say nothing about the horrendous rebranding of it into X, among other failed business ventures that led to him being outed as CEO from several companies such as PayPal and Zip2.

This got me thinking about the NBA owners and who some of the worst are/have been for years and how they compare to Musk were he to, say, own one of the eagerly anticipated expansion teams.

Some of the worst (current) owners include, in no particular order...

**Jody Allen, Blazers** \- From one of the more passionate owners in her brother Paul to one of the least.  A bone-smuggling, alleged sexual harasser, Jody oversaw the Blazers front office become a cesspool of  toxicity and players of increasing unhappiness.  I'm not just referring to Dame and the slow breakup of him and the Blazers, Gary Trent Jr. was reportedly ""depressed"" and ""played with so much pain"" for Portland's team according to his father.

The formation of a [toxic workplace/culture](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/03/1061295224/portland-trail-blazers-general-manager-neil-olshey-fired) is something you're going to see pop up a lot with these teams, by the way.

**Marc Cuban, Mavericks** \- Cuban is lucky the Mavericks won in 2011 because it made everyone forget that he broke up the dynamic duo of Dirk and future 2x MVP Steve Nash despite the two of them going deep into the playoffs.  Beyond wondering how the 2006 Finals would have looked were Cuban willing to pay Nash what he was worth, there's also the immediate breaking up of the 2011 Mavericks core in an attempt to free up cap space for a big name free agent and season after season of star chasing that never ended up yielding Dirk a co-star in his twilight years.

It is also worth mentioning that in 2018, [an investigation into Dallas' workplace](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/02/21/dallas-mavericks-sexual-misconduct-investigation-mark-cuban-response)was published.  It cited a predatory, misogynistic environment fostered by an immature manchild of an owner that was described as an ""animal house"", including allegations of domestic abuse unrelated to the well known abuse involving their current head coach, Jason Kidd.

**The DeVos family, Magic** \- Orlando has actually been run rather well of late - their fleecing of the Bulls is a testament to that - and their young core is amongst the more promising in the league.  That is largely in spite of the DeVos family's ownership who you might have recently learned about them owning the team - which has a predominantly black roster - after donating $50,000 to Ron DeRacist's campaign.

Beyond that, it shouldn't be forgotten how bad their post-Dwight, pre-Paolo rebuild ended up being, peaking at a first round exit as the 7th seed, albeit to the eventual champions in 2019, after putting their fans through hell for about 5 years.

**James Dolan, Knicks** \- Like the Magic, the Knicks have been run relatively well as of late.  That's good for them but it stands in contrast to the meddling and incompetence that Dolan was constantly responsible for post-Ewing.  Bad trades, massive overpays for washed players, botched draft picks, you name it, he's been a part of it.  Needless to say that if Dolan were still meddling, the Knicks would have thrown every pick and player asked of them for Donovan Mitchell.  Prolly even some young guys they were never asked to.

Even with the more hands-off approach, James managed to embroil the Knicks in controversy last season with his [employment of facial recognition software](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/02/james-dolan-madison-square-garden-move-saga-face-recognition) to intimidate people who are critical of his thin-skinned self on social media or the like.  He also kicked out Charles Oakley, a player who was with the team for over a decade, in the middle of a game and temporarily banned them from attending Knicks games.  And no, this isn't even the weirdest story involving Dolan and a Knicks player; just ask Carmelo Anthony about Dolan's staff spying on him.

Dolan hasn't been as bad *of* *late* but historically, few owners have the lengthy resume of futility and atrocious decision-making that Dolan does.  He deserves special consideration due to also owning the WNBA team New York Liberty (aka. a women's basketball team) at the time when hiring Isiah Thomas to run the team despite Thomas engaging in sexual harassment during his time with the Knicks in the 00s.  This was a particularly infamous case that ended up with a jury ruling in favor of Anucha Browne Sanders, a former woman executive of the Knicks who was fired after complaining about said sexual harassment, rewarding her nearly $12 million dollar in damages.

I eagerly await being banned from the garden for posting this.  Sell the team, Dolan.

**Vivek Ranadivé, Kings** \- I feel like the recent season of competence we've seen from the Kings in the 2022/23 season has made a lot of people forget how horrible the Kings have been.  Not all of the nearly two decades of basement-dwelling was Ranadivé's fault but since owning the team in 2013, it most certainly was.  Poor hiring decisions for the front office, awful trades and a failure to build around one of the few players that wasn't a draft bust during said tenure in DeMarcus Cousins, it should go without saying that being a fan of the Beam Team was excruciating, and while the Haliburton trade is now seen as a win-win, it cannot be understated how bad the move looked at the time when the Kings were 12th in the standings at the time and 12th come the season's end.

Once again, there's [allegations of a toxic work environment](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10032227-former-kings-employee-says-sacramento-has-toxic-workplace-and-is-basketball-hell) and mistreatment of staff, allegations that remain rather recent - a former employee made said allegations in 2022 - and should not be overlooked despite the otherwise optimistic and refreshing season Sacramento had last year.

*Honorable Mention*: **Michael Jordan, Hornets** \- The GOAT is no longer up for the crown amongst atrocious ownership but let it not be said that he didn't leave his mark on the franchise.  Quite literally up to the last minute as he had the final say on choosing Brandon Miller over Scoot Henderson, a decision which may seem to early to judge as a mistake were it not for MJ's historically awful drafting pedigree that dates back to his days with the Wizards.  Also a ton of overpay contracts for which Charlotte is still literally paying for to this day as Gordon Hayward enters the final year of his $120 million contract ($31.5M for this year).

So of these many owners, which ones were/are as bad as Elon Musk would be in this hypothetical?  I think James Dolan's record firmly places him as the worst current owner even with him not meddling in team affairs like he used to.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15l8yyo,0.24,False,1691473550.0

Second, he's a starting guard for the Los Angeles Lakers which will help him get the votes he needs esp when someone is injured. The fact that Steve Kerr got him in Team USA means he's gonna be loved by the coaches as well if he plays up to standards.

3. The Brooklyn Nets need to become the **Brooklyn Rap**. We already have the Jazz in the NBA and the St. Louis Blues in the NHL.  It would be cool if Rap had a team. The team is also owned by Jay Z and NYC is the birthplace of hip hop. Many famous rappers came out of Brooklyn specifically.

Conversely, football fans and management are often calling for their teams to try and form what would essentially be equivalent to a super team by grouping the most talented stars together. For example Real Madrid had a policy of purchasing the best players in the world to be part of what they referred to as the  ""Galacticos"". This policy lasted for nearly a decade and the only people who hated it were rival fans.

Last week, the big man lands the richest annual extension in NBA history as he has agreed on a three-year $186M max extension.

There is no denying how dominant Anthony Davis is on the court, however, the inconsistency is what’s frustrating. The elite big man has only played in 194 of 318 games as a Laker (61%).

Breaking it down even further, Anthony Davis has played an average of 60 games per season since being drafted in 2012. If he keeps that up, he will be making over $1M per game on his new $186M extension.

Let’s take a look at his projected salary for the next 5 years:

2023-24: $40.6M  
2024-25: $43.2M  
2025-26: $57.6M  
2026-27: $62.2M  
2027-28: $66.8M

Not only will he have earned about $500M on the court alone by age 34, but he will join Damian Lillard in the $60M club when 2027 rolls around.

- Had 4 of the top 15 highest gamescores in NBA finals history.
- Had 3 games over a BPM of 20 (game 5-6 2016 &amp; game 1 in 2018 finals)
- Against -6.9 relative to league avg defensive rating (based on Warriors performance in WC playoffs relative to playoff average) (gassing it up)

In comparison here's Mj's best 9 game finals stretch (92/93) offensively: 39.7 ppg 7.2 rpg 5.8 apg on 58% TS, amazing as well!

I remember seeing this post on twitter and it's kind of ashamed people were asking about his record while forgetting what he had to go against. So what do you guys think, is it the best 9 game finals stretch?

285,"Do people actually believe in the ""Nuggets got it easy by not playing the Bucks or Celtics in the final"" idea?",nba,"When some people discuss the most recent championship the asterisk for Denver is ""All they did was play low seeds so it was easy for them"". I'm a Nuggets fan so there's obviously bias on my end but from a logic POV how does this make any sense? So the 8th seed Heat (who dealt with injuries) defeated both the 1st and 2nd seed Bucks and Celtics in the playoff rounds leading to the final, which the Nuggets would then beat Miami for the championship. But if the Nuggets played teams who were proven to be worse - the Bucks or Celtics, it would have been more difficult for them and a more competitive finals series? 

Again how does this logic make any sense? Why didn't Milwaukee or Boston just beat Miami if they were worthy finals teams? And it's not like the Bucks had the ""Giannis was also injured"" excuse, they dropped 140 points on the Heat without him and should have 100% won the series regardless. And as for the 7th seed Lakers, they changed their squad and instantly improved their team half way through the season to be a top 4 team in the west. So if they played the 2nd seed Grizzlies, who lost to the Lakers in the first round, or the Kings who lost to a team the Lakers would also beat in the 2nd round, those teams would have gave Denver more trouble?

&gt; 
&gt; The company plans to charge users more if they want to watch sports on Max.
&gt; The new streaming tier will be branded under the Bleacher Report name and will include highlights and interviews in addition to games.


&gt; The NBA, which begins its regular season Oct. 24, has discussed a similar arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, where only games that air on the TNT cable network would be simulcast on Max, said the people familiar with the matter.

That said, there are certain [coaches](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/10/20/wes-unseld-jr-wizards-coach/) who will enter 2023-24 with *more* pressure than most. Here are 8 coaches who may feel the heat on their bums if they disappoint.

---

######**category 1: the leftovers**

**Wes Unseld Jr., Washington Wizards**

It's a difficult situation when a new general manager takes over and inherits a head coach. Almost always, that GM is going to want to hire ""his own guy"" at some point. Of course, they have to wait until a proper justification to fire the existing coach.

At this point, it's hard to blame Wes Unseld Jr. for the middling results of his Washington team. He's been given a below-average roster, and he's delivered below-average results (35-47 and 35-47 in back to back years). What complicates the math from here is that Unseld shouldn't be expected to do any better this year after the team traded away Bradley Beal. And they may not *want* to do much better if the goal is to rebuild and get a top pick in the draft.

So what can Unseld Jr. do to keep his job? I don't think it'll be about wins and losses. There's not going to be a big difference between 25 wins, 30 wins, 35 wins, it's all about the same in the long run. I'd say that Unseld needs to prove his worth and show that he has some tangible value to a team, and that would likely come on the defensive end. He came to the Wizards with a reputation as a defensive specialist, but his defenses have ranked # 25 and # 21 respectively in his first two years. But if Unseld can coach this group up to a **top 20 defense**, then that would give him a solid chance of survival. You don't need ""A+"" talent to play hard on the defensive end, so that's a reasonable goal for this team.

**Steve Clifford, Charlotte Hornets**

A coach is always in danger when there's a new GM in town, and that's doubly true when there's a new owner in town. The Hornets might be in line for a makeover, and that may not include the 61-year-old Steve Clifford. Heck, he wasn't even the old administration's first choice for the job to begin with (that would have been Kenny Atkinson, who slipped away at the last second).

Fortunately for Steve Clifford, he has some faint pathway to survival here. Despite the 27-55 record last year, the team isn't *that* bad. Last season was a nightmare, but they'll have LaMelo Ball back to full strength (after playing just 36 games). They'll have Miles Bridges back (and pretend to forget why he was gone). Sophomore Mark Williams may take a big step up and be an anchor down low. I don't think the play-in alone would be enough to keep Clifford safe, but if the team can **finish around .500**, that'd make it hard to fire Clifford. It'd mean an improvement of 15 games and put Clifford on the fringes of Coach of the Year talk.

**Chauncey Billups, Portland Trail Blazers**

Damian Lillard distanced himself from the Chauncey Billups hiring as soon as the team got flak for it, but he was no doubt a large reason why the franchise brought in the respected floor general in the first place. Billups was also supposed to help on the defensive end. So far, it hasn't gone according to plan.

If Lillard exits now, where does that leave Chauncey Billups? Where does that leave GM Joe Cronin? The whole situation  feels like a trainwreck that would require a cleanup crew afterwards -- and makes their departure feel somewhat inevitable. 

At the same time, there is some glimmer of hope here. If Damian Lillard leaves (for a minimal return), that'd leave a wide open lane for rookie Scoot Henderson to come barreling through. It's not outrageous to think that he can compete for 20 PPG and a Rookie of the Year trophy. And if **Scoot Henderson wins Rookie of the Year**, a lot of those bad vibes would go away. Alternatively, if Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe look lost, then you'd expect the team to shed Billups and find a more proven coach going forward.

**Jacque Vaughn, Brooklyn Nets**

It's easy to say that the Brooklyn Nets don't have any expectations at this point after losing Kevin Durant. And Kyrie Irving. And James Harden. This is a rebuilding situation, right?

Well... not entirely. This isn't as young of a team as you may expect. Later this month, Mikal Bridges will turn 27, matching the age of Cam Johnson and Ben Simmons. Those aren't young prospects -- those are players expected to be in their primes. Meanwhile, 3+D wings Dorian Finney-Smith and Royce O'Neale are already 30. This is a team that's good enough and old enough to compete for the playoffs.

I don't necessarily know if the Nets need to **make the playoffs** for Jacque Vaughn to keep his job, but it sure wouldn't hurt. If not, the team will likely make some big moves in the offseason -- either cashing in their chips for a star or going into a full rebuild instead. In either case, they may remake the coaching staff as well.

---

**Billy Donovan, Chicago Bulls**

Billy Donovan may be in a similar situation in Chicago. In fact, his roster is even older. If the Bulls **make the playoffs**, you can justify their decision to keep on chugging. If they fall short of that, it feels inevitable that the team will finally embrace a tear-down and rebuild.

If that happens, it may be a mutual decision to part ways. Donovan's background is in the NCAA so in theory he'd be well-suited to develop a young roster. At the same time, he's 58 years old and he'd have already coached for 9 years in the NBA. Does he have the patience for a reset? Would the team want young blood instead? All in all, it feels like this may be a make or break season for Donovan and the Bulls' sense of stagnation.

######**category 3: put up or shut up**

**Jason Kidd, Dallas Mavericks**

Owner Mark Cuban has a man-crush on Jason Kidd (who helped the team win a title as a player), but there's a limit to how far that affection can take you. If the Mavs don't improve drastically from their 38-44 record, then you'd have to expect a housecleaning here. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the Mavs need to **win a playoff series** for Kidd to feel totally safe in this situation.

Winning a series (or at least, making it competitive) isn't unrealistic for this team. There are some question marks about the center position and about the depth, but they have elite top-end talent in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Doncic is arguably a top 5 player in the league. And for all the criticism Irving gets, he's been lights out offensively over the last few years. If Grant Williams can come in and maintain his shooting from the corners (42.7% for his career), this offense should be one of the league's best. If they don't... Luka Doncic may be unhappy... which means Mark Cuban may be unhappy... which means Kidd may be in trouble.

---

**Willie Green, New Orleans Pelicans**

Although the New Orleans Pelicans didn't make the playoffs either, there are going to be high expectations for this club. They finished 42-40 despite only getting 29 games from Zion Williamson. No one's counting on Williamson to play a full 82, but he should at least play *more* than that. In theory.

If he does, this team is chocked full of talent -- both in terms of high-end stars but also in terms of depth. I suspect Willie Green will need to make the most of that and at least **make the playoffs** (health permitting). If they fall short again, it may be time for a more experienced hand. The market isn't great, but the roster's good enough to draw in some top coaching candidates.

---

**Joe Mazzulla, Boston Celtics**

In his first year on the job, Joe Mazzulla finished 57-25 and made the Eastern Conference Finals. For 95% of franchises, that'd be a home run. Instead, it got him all sorts of criticism for underachieving.

This year, Mazzulla should be bolstered by an even stronger roster and a stronger support staff, which will now include Charles Lee and Sam Cassell. In some ways, that's a double-edged sword. Perhaps more than any other coach, Mazzulla needs to ""win now"" -- as in, in the Fall and Winter of 2023. If the team stumbles out of the gates (let's say they have an 8-10 record), he may well be fired and replaced by Lee or Cassell.

Presuming the Celtics roll into the playoffs, the bar should still be high. In fact, I'd suspect Mazzulla will only feel comfortable if the team **makes the Finals**. Anything less will seem like a disappointment. Fortunately for Maz, all the talent's here to make that run.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15kniiy,0.89,False,1691421214.0

340,Is the idea of Scoot Henderson actually being a good G League player… true?,nba,"I posted this on r/nba_draft, and I would like to preface this by saying Scoot is a very talented player and was the 2nd best player in the draft.  Regardless of his efficiency, he is still a player who has potential to run an offense one day and be dynamic at the PG spot.


3 point shooting track record: 

Scoot is at: 
G League Reg Season career: 14/51 (27.5%) from 3


G League Showcase Career: 12/40 (30%) from 3 


and his free throw % is in the mid to low 70’s, it’s nothing great tbh


Since Scoot is a poor 3 point shooter and is only 6'2, he shoots around 58% at the rim overall iirc. However, most people don't acknowledge that Scoot doesn't actually get to the rim that much. He takes an extremely high volume of mid range shots which tank his effciency because even though he is good at them, they aren't inherently efficient shots when you have a bad 3 ball and only average FG at the rim

The G League has a rule where you shoot 1 free throw for 2 points, which heavily inflates his TS. If you were to assume that 1.8/2 free throws are only 2 point foul shots (meaning the other stuff is left out including techs, and 1s, etc.), his regular season TS this year would be 50%, which is likely the worst by far out of any G League guard that averages 16.5 (he averaged 16.5 points on 14.1 FGA)

If you want the proper efficiency metrics for his whole G League career;

&gt; So scoot had 441 pts on 142 twos 22 threes &amp; 54 FTs made. 142×2+22×3+54×1 = 404
441-404 = 37
""Normal"" rules he would have made 54+37 = 91 FTs

75% FT last year but 76.2 in both GL seasons combined.
 91÷.762 =119

370 FGAs last year + 119 FTAs × 0.44 = 422
441÷2÷422=52.3 TS%

Source: https://twitter.com/mikegrib8/status/1681413057980030976


Personally, I've known that Scoot was inefficient but I don't think it matters too much because he is still a very talented player for his age. I do have some worries about his efficiency though given he needs to be a star, and I'm not sure an inefficient lead guard without an ELITE trait as a creator (Maybe his mid range game, but I don't think his rim pressure is as good as advertised) might keep him ffrom 1 on a championship team. I do think he is clearly the 2nd best player in the draft though, he's just super talented with a great feel for the game on offense. If I had more confidence in his defense, if he was an outlier in terms of getting to the rim or better at shooting, I feel like he would have a decent argument for being a better prospect

&gt;  
&gt;*""Williams led a wide-ranging scheme to steal millions of dollars from the NBA Players' Health and Welfare Benefit Plan. Williams recruited medical professionals and others to expand his criminal conspiracy and maximize his ill-gotten gains. Williams not only lined his pockets through fraud and deceit, but he also stole the identities of others and threatened a witness to further his criminal endeavors. For his brazen criminal acts, Williams now faces years in prison.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;According to [Larry Neumeister](https://apnews.com/article/nba-health-fraud-williams-96bd079c6a3632addecde71efaed74e7) of the Associated Press, Williams' healthcare scam lasted from 2017 to 2021 and saw him defraud $5 million from the NBA Health and Welfare Benefit Plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;Williams enlisted the help of a dentist in California and doctors in both California and Washington to file claims for ""fictitious medical and dental expenses.""

“Jaren, particularly (Saturday), his energy and the way he went to the glass and went to the foul line every other possession,” said point guard Jalen Brunson, in articulating his support for Jackson. “He was just really a force (in the Saturday scrimmage against the U.S. Select Team).”

Starting lineup: Kareem, Hakeem, Shaq, Wilt, Bill Russell

Bench: David Robinson, Jokic, Moses Malone

Power Forwards: 

Starting lineup: Tim Duncan, Giannis, Dirk, KG, Karl Malone

Bench: Barkley, Mchale, Anthony Davis

Who would win?

The centers have more overall historical success and dominance but in a pure basketball lineup they are heavily lacking in spacing aside from Jokic and David Robinson, and Hakeem a bit but would be ridiculously dominant in the paint. Defensively they have ridiculous rim protection and paint defense but not great ability to defend out in the perimeter aside from Hakeem and bill Russell. Overall they don’t have much elite playmaking but of course they do have Jokic who’s one of the best playmakers of all time. All of them are dominant rebounders. Aside from Jokic don’t really have anyone who’s comfortable dribbling the ball for an extended period of time. 

Power forwards have a lot more versatility on offense and defense. They have guys who space the floor with 3s and midrange shots in dirk, KG, Tim Duncan, AD, Karl malone. Basically all of them are dominant paint scorers, particularly Barkley, Mchale, malone, Giannis. On defense they have have a lot of dominant rim protectors in Tim Duncan, KG, Giannis, AD. A lot of defensive versatility out on the perimeter in Giannis, KG, AD. 3 guys who can handle the ball and playmake in KG, Giannis, and Barkley.

Right now, LeBron is far and away more popular than any other player in the league, and now in LeBron’s 21st season, it makes me wonder when we will see the next player to reach the same stature as him. To me, it would have to be someone who is able to achieve being at least arguably the best player in the league status, as well as someone who has a really strong and charismatic personality. These are all traits that the 4 aforementioned players had.

407,All-Time Starting Five (stylistic fit - modern rules),nba,"PG - Steph Curry: Modern rules limiting contact against shooters and making defense less effective make Steph the best option here. Off-ball motion, passing, and shooting are all aspects of his game that make everyone around him better.

SG - Michael Jordan: I think Jordan may be a little overconfident for a team like this, but I can't put Kobe over him in good conscience. As above, the modern game emphasizes freedom of motion and scoring. Jordan's Off-ball movement is underrated, and his constant rim pressure would work very well next to Steph Curry specifically, especially considering the next 2 spots.

SF - Kevin Durant: KD's game is built for playing alongside superstars in the modern game.(shocker, I know) His size doesn't limit his effectiveness in a less physical game, and his ability to shoot from anywhere on the court while not being limited agility-wise would make him a dangerous off-ball threat no matter where he was on the court. Defensively, I also think it's worth mentioning that Durant has shown a greater willingness to play high level defense when his offensive load is lighter. In Golden State, he became a better shot blocker and inside presence overall while Steph and Klay could handle the offensive load without him being actively involved.

PF - Larry Bird: Definitely an uncommon choice at the 4 spot. Bird and Durant have very similar games, however, Bird is a better rebounder and is more floor-bound; which wouldn't be as much of a problem at the 4 as it would at the 3. In the modern game, Bird's IQ, shooting ability, and passing are more valuable than they even were in the 80's, while his defensive shortcomings are less important. Bird is also capable of hitting shots from all over the floor, and having a more effective post game at the 4 spot could be easily integrated to shake the offense up.

C - Kevin Garnett: Another unconventional choice. In the early 2000's, KG had to deal with centers like Shaq and David Robinson, and  could not effectively play that role. In 2023, KG is as reasonable a center as any. KG has shooting ability, can single-handedly anchor a defense on the inside, and would not have to deal with extensive rule changes. (Which is why Bill Russell and Wilt did not make the cut here) While we didn't get much of a chance to see it, KG was also a talented playmaker who would work better alongside HoF talent than more offensively oriented centers like Olajuwon or Shaq.

Let me know what you think! This list would absolutely change across different eras, and there is definitely a sport psychology perspective that deserves some discussion, but I'm curious what the community thinks about this.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15jvjus,0.43,False,1691343640.0

Also, it seems that no one really talks about how KD changed the landscape on how teams view propsects? Look at Brandon Ingram, Victor Wembanyama or even Emoni Bates. These guys from the time they are teenagers were pegged to be NBA superstars (though in the case of Bates, he's obviously a bust) just because play somewhat like KD (along with being skinny, tall, and being able to dribble and shoot).",t5_2qo4s,t3_15jt46q,0.25,False,1691337582.0

The increase in injuries has been occurring since the 90s and is a result of prolonged wear-and tear from AAU and youth basketball. Stop calling players soft, they're genuinely unable to play.

2. LeBron is the best scorer of all time. At minimum tied for top 3 or so. But you can't prove someone's better.

3. Superteams work well. Stacking all stars is the best route to winning a chip.

4. Anyone that devalues old legends' stats because old NBA was ""plumbers"" is wrong. Old stars had no one to learn from. If modern stars grew up in that era they'd be worse, and if old stars had modern training they'd be better.

5. Stephen Curry clearly deserves 3 FMVP ('15, '18, '22)

454,Who peaked higher: Nikola Jokic or Kevin Durant?,nba,"**Durant**

Kevin Durant is hailed as arguably the greatest scorer in NBA history due to his ability to score from quite literally anywhere on the floor, at a *very* high rate, in any which way. He also has 4 scoring titles to help his case. He hasn't won one since 2014 primarily due to injuries and star-studded rosters (I mean this in a very positive manner) which do not require him to score a million points every night. It would probably be a detriment to the team if Durant just ISO'd every play.

Durant was always in the conversation for best player in the league but could never quite get the title due to LeBron being at his peak and prime literally throughout KD's **entire career**, however gained notoriety for it after his title wins, with the bulk of it coming in 2019 after he was going nuts with a struggling Curry and LeBron out of the playoffs. His best case was after the Bucks series when he put up monster performances after his teammates went down, and people seriously considered him the best as the Bucks would've gotten white-washed if they were healthy. This time range can be from 2018-2021.

**The Joker**

Jokic came onto the scene much later, as his case for best player in the league laughably came during these playoffs, even though he was the **back-to-back MVP**, and only lost because he and the team threw in the towel towards the end of the season with Perkins running an anti-Jokic campaign on the outside.

He was clearly the best player in the postseason (honourably mention to Curry and Butler), and completely DOMINATED every team he played in ways I haven't really seen Durant do. He is clearly at his peak (or close to it). The one thing that is not in his favour is reps. He needs to have a bit more longevity to solidify his greatness.

Flynn's decent rookie season seems like an outlier after failing to find  a role on a Raptors team that desperately needed (and still does!) a backup point guard, to say nothing of shooting that Flynn should, in theory, provide.  With the loss of Fred VanVleet and a change to a head coach that presumably doesn't hate him, there are neither excuses nor lack of opportunity for Malachi.  If he doesn't make the most of it, it would be shocking to see him get a 2nd contract.  
**Killian Hayes**

**22/23 Stats - 10.2/2.9/6.2 on 38/28/82 splits**

It almost feels like cheating to include Hayes because the same  thing was said about him last year when the Pistons lost Cade Cunningham to injury.  The only difference is he's - you guessed it - in a contract year and is almost certainly not getting extended, let alone a serious offer in free agency next year unless he can show any improvement.

  
**James Wiseman**

**22/23 Stats - 10/5.9/0.7 on 56/20/70 splits**

No, not every name on this list is going to be an upcoming RFA from the 2020 draft class but James Wiseman is especially worth noting because he is battling for his minutes against the similarly athletic  bigs on Detroit's roster in Jalen Duren and Marvin Bagley, and while both of them have their flaws - Bagley in particular is another candidate to consider for this list - none of them make one cry via their advanced stats like James Wiseman does.  Given how much he's making as the former 2nd overall pick from that draft, James is going to have to seriously impress in order to receive a second contract on par with what he's being paid in his final year.

&amp;#x200B;

**James Bouknight**

**22/23 Stats - 5.6/2.1/1.2 on 36/30/67 splits**

It's too soon to write off Charlotte's DUI-doing shooting guard as a bust but when one compares him to his fellow lottery picks from the 2021 draft, even the ones who had their own notable sophomore slumps, Bouknight stands out for all the wrong reasons.  A shooter who can't shoot and rarely available - he played a combined 60 games over the past 2 seasons - the best thing one could say about his prior season was it let the Hornets be bad enough for a high draft pick that will likely come to haunt the franchise for passing over Scoot Henderson as it was used on Brandon Miller instead.  

That last part admittedly wasn't his fault, granted, but the point still stands:  Bouknight is rapidly approaching bust territory and with the addition of the promising Nick Smith Jr. to the roster, James' position in Charlotte's backcourt rotation looks incredibly insecure going into the season.

&amp;#x200B;

**Patrick Williams**

**22/23 Stats - 10.2/4.0/1.2 on 46/42/86 splits**

Another 2020 draftee, Patrick Williams is in perhaps the most precarious position of those mentioned.  Considering that one of these players is on the Hornets, that is saying a lot.  Stuck on a Bulls team trying to contend with DeMar/LaVine/Vucevic all higher in the pecking order that's had a painfully poor record of developing its talent, Williams isn't going to get the same opportunities that others on this list might and his chances of being a tank commander are equally lacking in promise but whatever opportunities he can get, he needs to take them to prove the flashes he's shown are a sign of something greater than he currently is.

  
**Zion Williamson**

**22/23 Stats - 26/7/4.6 on 61/37/71 splits**

When he's on the court, he's an MVP candidate, so Zion doesn't have to prove himself like the above in the same way.  He just has to prove he can stay healthy for most of a given season.  He was on the floor for 29 games last year, missed out on the whole season prior and all but 24 games in his rookie season.  61 games in his sophomore season is his career high and seemingly an exception at that.    


**Ben Simmons**

**22/23 Stats - 6.9/6.3/6.1 on 57/0/44 splits**

It feels weird to list arguably the most accomplished player (Note:  ""Accomplished"" doesn't mean ""best"") on this list at the end but Ben is in a particularly unique circumstance.  On a Brooklyn team that has to build around the margins and a hefty contract that would make it difficult for anyone else to take a flier on him, the former 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team and Jenner enthusiast, one would hope the young socialite will have a healthier season than the past two so we can see if there's a training arc in Ben that leads to the best version of himself. At 27 years old, time is very much against him but it's not as if late blooming point guards like Chauncey Billups and Kyle Lowry are nonexistent.

465,Is Jokic a Top 5 offensive player of all time?,nba,"When it comes to **PEAK**, do you think Jokic is a Top 5 offensive player of all time?


I probably have LeBron and Jordan above him. 


Larry vs Jokic: Jokic with his 3 year peak, probably surpasses Larry in terms of offense. Larry is the GOAT of the regular season but he has noticeable playoff drops which Jokic rarely has. He's probs better a better offensive player than Larry because of his sustained high efficiency on the floor with less help. Jokic is also a better playoff performer offensively.



Jokic vs Magic: Magic is probably the better playmaker but Jokic is easily the better scorer so I have Jokic over Magic offensively IMO.



Jokic vs Curry: They're both hyper efficient but Jokic is a way better traditional playmaker. I have Jokic slightly ahead offensively.



Jokic vs Kareem: Kareem is a better scorer for his era. Jokic is a better playmaker and it ain't close. But this is a really close one. I'd slightly lean Jokic because he played in a more competitive era.



Jokic vs Shaq: This one is also close. Shaq had more gravity and was more dominant. Both were hyper efficient but Jokic spaced the floor more but you cannot physically stop Shaq. It's a tie for the both of them.



Jokic vs Duncan: Jokic is easily the better offensive player.



Jokic vs Hakeem: Jokic is the better scorer and a better playmaker. Therefore, Jokic is easily the better offensive player.



Jokic vs Wilt: According to Thinking Basketball, Wilt's 50 point season is overrated and eye test wise, Jokic clears. More on that later.



Jokic vs Bill: Not even close.




In conclusion, the Top 5 offensive players are in no order: LeBron, Jordan, Kareem, Shaq, Jokic.


 Jokic is at least a Top 5 offensive player if you consider how great his efficiency is and his brilliant playmaking all together while not having a GOATED supporting cast.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15jd5s0,0.4,False,1691286581.0

&gt; On Friday and again Saturday against the U.S. Select Team, Jalen Brunson, Brandon Ingram, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Mikal Bridges started for the national team, which will compete at the FIBA World Cup this month.

&gt;**In Friday’s loss to the Select Team, Cam Johnson was the fifth starter. But in Team USA’s commanding 84-61 win over the Select Team in three, 10-minute periods, Anthony Edwards opened with the starting unit.** The next time the Americans play will be their first exhibition game, at 10:30 p.m. Monday against Puerto Rico, and if consistency in scrimmages means anything the starters will probably come out of those six.

&gt; **“I have nothing set in stone,” Kerr insisted after the Saturday scrimmage.”We’re learning as we go. I thought we learned a lot from yesterday and we’ll learn a lot from today.** It’s great to have these things on tape so we can go back and look at stuff.

&gt;“There will be a lot of really interesting possible combinations just because of the skill these guys have.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Kerr was raving about the passing ability the Americans showed through two scrimmages, and there were a number of context clues from commentary on how Team USA’s collective ball movement has allowed the team to bond quickly. “I think passing does that in general,” Kerr said. “When you have good passers, teams connect quickly. … Brandon Ingram made about four drive-and-kicks yesterday that were incredible plays, leading to wide-open shots. Anthony Edwards has really been moving the ball. And some of these guys have it come so naturally to them, Tyrese (Haliburton), Austin Reaves – these guys are great passers. Jalen from the point guard spot. Mikal as well, and you start adding in the bigs. They’re all of a sudden out of a short roll. We’re getting swings to the perimeter. The whole group is connected and it’s really fun to watch.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Edwards said he’s “ready to play, whatever they ask me to do. “Score the ball, create open shots for others,” Edwards said, when describing what Team USA has asked him to do. “I can get by my man pretty, pretty easily so get by my man, make the team help and you create shots. I also have to defend, rebound, and just, you know, be a voice.”

&gt;Johnson similarly deflected any intent or desire on the starting lineup question, saying “we have guys that are very versatile across the board, and I think that’s just how we want to play.”",t5_2qo4s,t3_15j9gzt,0.96,False,1691276324.0

497,"""People want to compare me to Michael in his prime, and that's unfair."" - Kobe Bryant (2003)",nba,"At 24, Kobe Bryant has three rings. At that age, Jordan had zero. At 24, Kobe has better all-around court sense, a better J and, unthinkably, even more madly creative mid-air Gumbyness than Jordan did. At 24, Kobe is hitting 38.5% of his treys; Jordan was shooting 18%. Over the last four weeks Kobe was on a mind-warping, pupil-popping, scorched-earth tear during which he scored 35 or more points in 13 straight games. Jordan hadn't done that at 24. Come to think of it, Jordan still hasn't done that.

""He's the best player in the game right now,"" Utah guard Mark Jackson said last week, after Kobe went for 40 points to help the Shaqless Lakers beat the Jazz. ""He's playing basketball that's as  
good as I've seen in my career."" Of course, Jackson's only been in the league for 16 years.

So why can't America embrace Kobe and his ozone-piercing potential? Why can't they realize that falling in love with Kobe doesn't mean breaking up with Michael? I mean, what's not to  
love?

Here's a young man who speaks fluent Italian, is married and has a child, and never shows up in the back of a squad car. Here's a pro who works out eight hours a day in the off-season, who one summer wouldn't go home until he'd made 1,000 jumpers a day. Here's a young god who's runway handsome, GQ cool and Eagle Scout nice.

In Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals in San Antonio last May, he blew up for 12 points in the fourth quarter to beat the Spurs. He was seconds from going live with NBC when he saw a  
small boy crying over the loss. He left the interviewer, went over and hugged the kid. Yet all anybody wants to do is line him up against Jordan and make sure he loses. Kobe's getting sick of  
it, and I don't blame him.

""People want to compare me with Michael in his prime,"" he says, ""and that's unfair. I don't think I'm in my prime yet. I think a player's prime is, like, 26 to 30. I'm only 24. But that's all they want to talk about. They're not saying, 'Kobe worked really hard at getting better at this.' Or, 'This is what I appreciate about Kobe.' It's always what I do in relation to Michael. Like, they say my competitiveness came from watching Michael. It never crossed their minds that I've been like this since I was five.""

Savor this kid. Wallow in his starshine. Be stupefied, mind-boggled, brain-bent. He's writing his legend right under our noses. Beats his man left-hand dribble, skies baseline and flushes over Yao Ming? Catches a long outlet, goes behind his back to lose a Denver Nugget and 360 slams? Driving the baseline, takes off outside the paint, loses Latrell Sprewell in midair and reverse dunks on the far side of the rim? And that's just in the last three weeks.

You want to argue? Bring it.

Jordan never had a Shaq. True, and Kobe never had a Hall of Fame swingman like Scottie Pippen. Or a rebound-munching forward as Dennis Rodman was in his prime. You think he wouldn't be handy to have around? Why, yes, Dennis, I would like to shoot again, thanks!

Jordan won 10 scoring titles. Kobe's got zilch. I watched Kobe score 56 in three quarters against Memphis last season--the man could win a scoring title wearing Muppet slippers. But many nights he has to put his ego in a jar to keep Shaq-Fu happy and well-fed with points. Plus, Kobe has the burden of handling the rock an awful lot--more than Jordan. ""I'm not saying it's harder,"" says Kobe, ""but it consumes a lot more energy, having those little guards crawling on you all the time. It's definitely more running.""

Kobe doesn't D-up like Jordan. True, but he's learning. He's increased his steals from 1.48 a game last season to 2.24 this season. He's averaging a career-best 7.0 rebounds, too. Jordan only beat that once. He's got the Bally's body at 24 that Jordan didn't build until he was 30.

I don't see six rings on Kobe's fingers. Let's say Kobe retires when Jordan will, at 40. That means he'd play 23 seasons. You think Kobe can't get four more rings in the next 16 seasons? ""Seven rings, eight rings, nine rings,"" Kobe says, ""I don't care. I just want to win. Every year.""

Yeah, well, the world will never love Kobe as much as Jordan. True, but maybe that's because Michael came first. If the order had been reversed, would Kobe have the IMAX movies, the jingles  
and the shoes? Would Michael be the one wearing Kobe's throwback at the All-Star Game?

They said nobody would ever punk Ruth's numbers. Then came Aaron.  
They said nobody would go lower than Nicklaus. Then came Tiger.  
Just roll the possibility around on your tongue for a second:  
Kobe Bryant could end up the greatest player in NBA history.

""Ooh,"" says Kobe, ""you just gave me goose bumps.""

The feeling is mutual.

Right now, all eyes are on Morey ... if they don’t get out of the second round, he’s going to take the blame ... He could be the guy that goes.",nba,"&gt; Scotto: Daryl Morey has shown through his executive tenure with the Sixers and Rockets that he’s always been able to get star players. If Harden is traded, Morey could go all in on cap space for next summer and try to pair another star with Embiid and Maxey as the core going forward. As Morey looks to tinker with Philadelphia’s roster, he’s not an executive who’s gone through a rebuild, so I wonder how long he could stay with the Sixers depending on what happens with the Harden trade and potentially a transformative summer for the team in 2024.

&gt; Pompey: The rhetoric that’s coming out now is if they don’t get it done this year, they’ll have a lot of cap space next year. It sounds like that gives you an extra year to see if you can get things done. The problem that Morey faces is before you had Doc Rivers, who you could blame, you could blame “The Process,” you could blame other people. Right now, all eyes are on Morey. He came here to bring James Harden. He’s also one of the most recognizable front-office executives in pro sports. The fact that he took over a Sixers team, and if they don’t get out of the second round, he’s going to take the blame and the brunt of it. He could be the guy that goes.

&gt; It’s one of those things where they blamed it on the coaching. People felt like the Sixers were a couple of adjustments away from getting out of the second round. Of course, everyone is going to look at the Harden situation. Morey is making a lot of money, and when he came in here, the Sixers were supposed to ascend. When Brett Brown was the coach, it was the second round. When Elton Brand was leading the front office, it was the second round. Now, you’ve got Morey and three max players or close to it in Harden, Embiid, and Tobias Harris, and it’s been three seasons in a row that they ended their season in the second round. I think Morey could be in trouble if they don’t get out of the second round.

The Mavs finish top 3 in the West with 52+ wins and beat the Suns in 5 in the WCF.
* **Average case:** The team is improved but not enough to be a playoff lock. Luka and Kyrie miss some games now and then for injuries/miscellaneous reasons but not enough to derail the team. The rookies show promise but aren't ready to be rotation players on a contender yet. The Mavs win around 42-44 games and make the playoffs but through the play-in tournament and lose in a hard-fought first round series to Denver.
* **Worst case:** Luka and Kyrie have significant chemistry issues and injury struggles that derail the team's success.

Jimmy has never had that second option that can take the pressure off of him during his tenure in Miami, whereas Davis has LeBron (who can be argued as their #1). This has led to Miami being outclassed in both Finals.

563,Who is the best player to never get their jersey retired?,nba,"When teams who have few rings earn one, they often give props to nearly the entire starting line-up, and some times bench players. 

The Pistons, for example, have retired jerseys for Zeke, Dumars, Laimbeer, Rodman, and even Vinnie Johnson (poor Mark Aquirre). They've also retired Big Ben's number, and RIP's, and Chauncy's (poor Sheed and Prince). 

And even marquee names like Davie Bing and Bob Lanier got their numbers up. 

This goes across the board. Barkley has his number up in the rafters in Philly and Phoenix. 

But some important role players (like Kenny Smith, Sam Cassell, Mad Max, and Horry in Houston) don't get so much love, and even former All-Stars who won rings, like Otis Thorpe, don't get a jersey in the rafter (though Drexler did).

&amp;#x200B;

And some HOFers don't have a jersey retired at all.

The best one that comes to mind is McGrady. Splitting his time between so many teams and never seeing any playoff success certainly puts a dent in his options. 

But that got me thinking: Who is the BEST player to never get his jersey retired ANYWHERE?

569,Hottest Thunder Take of the Summer,nba,"I don't see a lot of differences in terms of talent at each role between the Thunder and the Grizzlies. The Thunder could be the second best team in the West next year. The Grizzlies were 2nd in the West by a solid margin over a scrappy Kings team.

Consider:


Shai = Morant


Chet/Dort = Adams/JJJ (most egregious error, I know, this is a hot take)


Jdub = Bane


Giddey = Smart




Now, maybe it's the defense that is lacking. But I see a lot of upside in continuity. Smart is a great defender, but the Celtics were kind of his team in a way. The defense was anchored on him. In Memphis, I think they have to figure it out. 


Also, on the group of talls and Dort: Chet will shoot and make as many  3's as JJJ. I think they will have similar blocks. I think JJJ is WAY BETTER than Chet as a rookie this year. However, Dort is a top tier guard-anyone player in the league.  With solid rim protection help coming from Chet, Dort is going to be even better. JJJ and Adams also protect the rim. All four players rebound their asses off. I think, for the purpose of this argument, it's a wash. Adams is a one-man offensive rebounding machine, and he contributes greatly to winning with screens. I doubt Chet will screen as effectively, as Adams, who is the best, but he will be serviceable for SGA as a pick-and-roll partner in a similar way to the Morant/Adams PNR.  

Giddey and Smart are both great playmakers. Where Giddey has a size advantage, Smart has a dribbling advantage. Similar 3-pt % for the two is my prediction. Smart probably shoots 2x the attempts. 


And  now for the best part: JDUB. This kid is a fucking all-time legend. The night man cometh. It was funny how at first   he was adjusting to NBA speed, and then he just hit a player improvement trajectory like a fucking rocket ship to outer space. I mean, he was taking over games. Straight up, Jdub can ball. I would never trade him for Bane, a max-contract player now, if you gave me 2 future firsts on top. Untouchable. Bane got that dog in him, but Jdub got the GOAT in him.

*Nowitzki, however, sounds genuinely glad that he’ll be enshrined with Wade. Nowitzki said he and Wade “actually bonded” in Houston in early April when the Hall Class of ‘23 was announced.*

*“Obviously we’ve gone through a lot, some ups and downs,” Nowitzki said. “But at the end of the day he is one of the greatest players ever to play the game, so it’s an honor to have him in the class.”*

*In 2006, the Mavericks certainly weren’t thrilled that a steady Wade parade to the free-throw line (97 attempts!) factored heavily into Miami’s comeback. And Nowitzki didn’t appreciate Wade and LeBron James* [***mocking and seemingly calling into question his 102-degree fever***](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2014/06/13/nowitzki-recalls-being-mocked-by-lebron-dwyane-wade-in-2011-i-just-didnt-think-it-was-funny/) *in Game 4 of the 2011 Finals, calling their behavior “childish.”*

*Nowitzki is 45 now. Wade is 41. The gradual thawing of their differences showed when,* [***after playing their final game against one another***](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2019/03/29/dirk-nowitzki-dwyane-wade-finale-featured-thrilling-co-main-event-with-a-pair-of-slovenians/) *on Feb. 13, 2019 in American Airlines Center, Wade asked Nowitzki for a jersey swap.*

*If any hard feelings lingered in the next four years, they seemingly were buried in Houston four months ago.*

*“We sat together with his family during one of the dinners, and we talked,” Nowitzki said. “And so I think it’s going to be great. I think there’s a lot of mutual respect there now.*

*“I know we’ve gone through some stuff in our careers, but at the end of the day not everybody you compete against at the highest level can be friends. It’s just not how it works.*

*“I think there were some things said on both sides that weren’t liked by the other side, but you know what? This is 20-something years later now, almost. So there’s really now hard feelings, and it’s gonna be a fun week with him.”*",t5_2qo4s,t3_15if871,0.95,False,1691191037.0

&gt; Thursday, when asked about the possibility of Las Vegas being home to an NBA team, Team USA coach Steve Kerr enthusiastically supported the idea, adding he felt similarly about the league returning to Seattle.

&gt; **""It feels right,"" Kerr said. ""Obviously it's not my department, but Vegas and Seattle seem to be such smart franchises. It's a shame that we ever lost the Sonics in the first place. But as you look forward and you think of what we need, we need a couple of Western time slots. Think about all the doubleheaders on TV you have where the second game is starting at 8:40 central time. We lost a couple of West Coast time slots back when Seattle and Vancouver left the league. It hurt the TV schedule, which hurt the whole league schedule.**

&gt; ""You factor in Vegas for the time slot. But also just how great of a venue this is for summer league, USA basketball, the fans here have proven they'll come out, they love the Aces. The Knights just won the Stanley Cup, the Raiders are filling it up every Sunday. So this seems like a really good next team.""

&gt;Kerr's answer led to a funny exchange with a reporter who brought up to the coach that the Final Four would be held in Las Vegas this upcoming season.

&gt;When Kerr said he didn't realize the NCAA tournament Final Four would be in Las Vegas, it was quickly clarified by the reporter that the final four in question was actually the NBA's first in-season tournament, with the semifinals and championship game set for Dec. 7 and 9.

https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2010.html

13.1 mpg is a pretty high number. Most teams each year have ~3-5 players who average less than 10 mpg; these players just get in at garbage time mostly.

The unique thing about that 09-10 Warriors team was just how truly decimated they were by injuries throughout that season (and their refusal to sign players to fill in). So, if you got in the game, you were usually going to play ~20 min. (or 48, if you judge by game 82 that year)

583,"[OC] How a basketball simulation engine ranks the best players of all time. AKA ""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!""",nba,"""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!"" Well, what if it was? 

The website WhatIfSports allows users to build their own virtual basketball teams from any season of any player in NBA/ABA history. Your virtual team will play simulated games against other teams, where every single possession of every single game is simulated for a new season of virtual basketball. **The engine uses real life results from players to simulate new possessions.** There are leagues of virtual teams that play 82 simulated games plus playoffs. As an avid WIS player, looking at all players' stats under a microscope has given me an interesting perspective. 

I have been playing on WiS for close to 10 years, and have decided to share some of what I learned here. **I do not believe that this is the actual all-time rankings of these players.** But this is roughly how players (or rather the results of players' regular season stats) look to the eyes of a simulation engine. ***This is who The SIM thinks the greatest players of all time are.*** 
_________________________________________
###Identifying the top players through a statistical lens. The best players: according to WhatIfSports' Simulation Engine.
_________________________________________
**The methodology:** 

There are lots of different game formats for WhatIfSports. Most of them involve a salary cap. We're not looking at data from those leagues; it would skew the data with an extra variable. Most formats also involve selecting the best season and only the best season of a player's career, which skews data towards players who peaked for one season; I also do not want this data, as it just looks at one year. So for this exercise, I will be looking at data from the ""Savage League""; which has no salary cap, and uses the 5 best seasons of a player's career (doesn't have to be consecutive)
&gt;**This allows us to identify the 5-best statistical years of players' careers.** So not quite ""best careers"", and not quite ""best peaks"" (since the 5 seasons don't have to be consecutive), but somewhere in-between. 


The Savage League is a draft league that has each of 24 users draft 12 players (288 total NBA/ABA players) and then assemble 5 unique teams that each contain one unique season of each of your 12 players. So if you draft Michael Jordan, you pick 5 of his seasons and put one on each of your 5 teams, and repeat for your other 11 players (with a lot more strategy involved that I don't need to get into.) and pit your 5 teams against 23 GMs who each have 5 teams. You set your lineups and set some basic strategy, and then the website will simulate matchups over the course of 82 games + playoffs against other users. Every season of every player in NBA history is eligible to be drafted, and trust me, we scour the obscure guys to find any advantage we can. 

I have participated in this league since it's inception, and I have lots of first hand knowledge, but I will mostly be relying on **ADP** (average draft position) plus the **results of the simulated teams** that had these players. So basically we will be working with a **modified ADP that bumps players up or down a bit based on how many wins the team that drafted them usually gets.** There is 11 seasons worth of data. 
____________________________________

Okay, let's look how this website/method is and isn't perfect. 

**What *isn't* a problem:**

- **Era-normalization:** This is not really a problem. We (the GMs) and the website (the ""Sim"") look at things in a *""per possession""* context. Usage rate, eFG%, foul draw rate, AST%, TO%, OREB%, DREB%, yada yada. All per-possession. So if Player A and Player B played in two separate eras with two vastly different paces, the stats will normalize that accordingly. 
&gt;Example: we don't care about how many rebounds a player grabbed per game. We don't even care how many rebounds a player grabbed per36; we care about what % of available rebounds that player was able to grab.
&gt;&gt;There is also a small adjustment made to all players' 2FG% and 3FG% based on the average effectiveness of the era, and the website even approximated 3PM of players who played pre-3pt era, as well as approximating blocks/steals/etc for eras where that info wasn't tracked. It's not perfect, but it's not as big as a problem as you probably assumed it was, and I don't think there's a better solution out there. 

- **User/human biases:** I don't think this is a problem. We all pay $50 to play a season of Savage simply for bragging rights of winning the league, and the two worst finishers have to sit out the next time around. A user will rarely ever draft a player just because he/she likes them. We're all trying to make the best teams. Even if there is some human bias in selection, I am weighing the results by actual wins in the sim, and the sim has no bias. 
&gt;Example: I have drafted both Karl Malone and Miles Bridges even though I dislike both of them. It's all about winning, baby. 

- **Roster Fit/Chemistry:** This isn't a problem. You have to build teams to compliment your other players' strengths. This isn't like a fantasy basketball team where you just sum the raw ""points"" your players produced. You still need to have a good balance of passing/spacing/rebounding/defense/positional versatility/bench/etc etc on your team. The engine is simulating what it thinks would happen if your players were on the court at the same time against your opponent's players. 
&gt;Example: If you have Amare plus 3 good passers like Magic, Bird, and Draymond, then your Amare will probably score a higher FG% than he did in real life. If you put players who barely pass around Amare and make him create for himself, it would be lower. 
&gt;&gt;Even though Draymond Green, Ben Simmons, Rajon Rondo, Ben Wallace, and Dennis Rodman are all great players in this format, you can't game the system by putting them all on the same team. Everyone would pack the paint on D against you and you'd struggle to score.  

**What actually *is* a problem with this methodology:** 

- **Style of play is nearly-invisible to the stats:** The sim has no way of knowing that a player like Melo or Barkley would eat away the shotclock on ISOs. It just sees what % of possessions the player used, and what the results of those possessions were, and how the players around them might affect it. Unlike a video game, there's no physical attribute ""speed"", ""agility"", etc ratings.

- **Defensive ratings are imperfect:** While most of the numbers on a player's card are based on their actual real-life stats, there is one semi-arbitrary number: defense. The website assigns a 0-100 score for every player's defense, and there is some human error in this one component. All-D and DPOY awards boost this score. There's a lot of accuracy in some instances. But for some players, the ratings are inaccurate. 
&gt;Also, the website doesn't have a way to differentiate if a player is good at certain aspects of defense (on ISOs vs help, on perimeter vs paint, rotations, etc), just if they're good/average/bad at D overall, and how effective they are at guarding each position.

- **Teammate boosts:** DeAndre Jordan shot over 70% in 3 of his seasons that he played with Chris Paul. The website has no way to separate how good he would have been in a vacuum/without Chris Paul in those seasons. So DeAndre Jordan is a very very very good player in the Sim and we don't know how accurate that would be. It's not as big of a problem as you're imagining. He still only shoots roughly as often as he did irl, so he's still just a putback &amp; lob type of guy in the Sim. If you paired him with say Jordan Clarkson as his PG in the sim, his numbers would drop significantly, just like in real life. But it is a small issue. 

- **The Sim can't see invisible things** like well-set screens, boxing out, etc. This means that Brook Lopez is considered a bad rebounder in the sim. In real life, we know that he helps his team secure rebounds even though he doesn't grab them often himself. This could be solved if someone ever made a more complex sim that looked at on-floor/off-floor ratings too. It also doesn't factor in clutch rankings, mental toughness, etc. 

**Gray area problems** These are things that I don't think are a problem but someone might argue that they are:

- **Era-styles:** Up above I explained how everything is pace-normalized and how efficiency is era-adjusted. The one caveat to that is that 3-point attempt rates are going to stay what they were. In real life, Larry Bird never made more than 90 3s in a season. Some people might say ""if he played today, he'd attempt 600 per season!"" Well, he didn't. I think trying to make him shoot more 3s on-paper than he did irl would lead to more problems than it solves, but just putting this here for anyone who has this thought/question. 

- **Minutes:** Players can only play roughly the amount of minutes that they played in real life before they start to get ""fatigued"" or injured. You could argue that if a bench player was given more opportunity, they could play more minutes just fine. I could argue that if we took all of the elite low-MPG guys and could play them starter minutes without penalties, Boban would be a top 50 player. I think it's better the way that it is. 
________________________

**With that said, here are the highlights of the rankings:**

**1. LeBron James.** In this world, this isn't ever even a debate. He's #1 in this by a good margin. We've even discussed making his 6-10th best seasons a separate draftable player, and most people agree that version would be a top 5 pick if so. 

**2-6: Wilt Chamberlain, Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, Giannis, Kareem.** Roughly in that order. 

**7-9: Shaq, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul.** All three of these guys usually get drafted around here, and interestingly their teams all win about the same amount as each other on average. 

**10-18: David Robinson, Karl Malone, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Charles Barkley, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird.** Jokic is very divisive among us right now. His offensive stats are INSANE (I don't think the average NBA fan still understands how insane), but his defense is the worst out of every player you'd be considering in the first round. Gobert's numbers are phenomenal when looked at this way, and I think more of Utah's success from those years should be attributed to him by the average fan. Kawhi is the winningest player in this format and he keeps moving up. He used to be drafted around 28th but keeps winning and keeps getting drafted higher. A lot of his benefits are hard to notice at first glance. 

**19-24: Anthony Davis, DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan** For what it's worth, teams picking around here usually win more than those picking at the beginning (snake draft). These are all really good players in this format. 

**25-33: Julius Erving, Dwyane Wade, John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Ben Wallace, Scottie Pippen, Artis Gilmore, Moses Malone, Kevin McHale** Dr J has been quite successful lately, his teams have been winning a lot. 

From this point on I'll just drop in a few highlights: 

**Damian Lillard** has been going around 35th lately and has seen a lot of success on his teams at that selection, meaning he's going to start going even higher soon. He's very efficient. 

**Bill Russell** is about 40th. He has a great defensive rating and grabs a ton of boards (but not as many as he did irl due to pace-adjusting), but he is extremely inefficient at scoring, even with an era-adjusted boost. He's a decent passer, but when you look at it through the eyes of a per-possession lens, it's not nearly as impressive as his raw ""assist per game"" stats. For instance: in 64-65, he had 5.3 assists per game, but he also played 44.4 MPG at a really high possession pace. When you look at the same season at a per possession basis, he was getting assists at the same clip as 22-23 Jarred Vanderbilt.

**Shawn Marion** (~50th), **Bobby Jones** (~60th), **Horace Grant** (~65th), **Andrei Kirilenko** (~75th), **Sidney Moncrief** (~80th) are all examples of guys who don't get talked about enough in NBA circles who are really really freaking good. Go look up their BBallRef pages. They're all beasts in this format. I don't think it's a coincidence that all of them were on lots of winning teams in real life. 

**Manu** goes about 60th and **Tony Parker** rarely gets drafted, but will get drafted at about 240th if he does. Manu's per possession stats are insane.

**Dirk** goes around 150th usually. His scoring efficiency isn't as great as you'd think. His defense isn't great. His offensive rebounds are extremely low for a big man. He didn't shoot as many 3s as you imagine. He's a good, clean, player (great FTs, low TOs and fouls), but when you look at the numbers this way, he's several tiers below Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Charles Barkley, and Kevin Garnett. **Chris Webber** is about 200th. 

**Kobe** is about 60th. He's just far too inefficient to be a first or second rounder, but he can be a good pick in the 3rd round with the right team around him. (**Pau Gasol** is about 90th, **Bynum** is about 140th, and **Odom** is about 250th, for what it's worth)

**Oscar Robertson** goes around 40th. He's a lot more efficient than most guys from his era. His rebound and assist numbers are not nearly as impressive in a per-possession context though. 

**Russell Westbrook** is about 150th. He can single handedly tank your efficiency and TOs, but if you have the right pieces around him, he can be a contributor on a winning team. I'm not sure if the average fan understands truly how different his efficiency is vs someone like Steph. For context, Westbrook rebounds and assists at a much much higher rate than the Big O (when looked at per possession, not per game), but Oscar is still good at both while being a more efficient scorer who turns the ball over far less. 

**Walt Frazier** goes about 60th. **Willis Reed** is about 110th. 

**Grant Hill** usually gets drafted around 200th but is also the worst performer out of the entire field. His teams lose the most often. I think his eye test looks a lot better than his on-paper results. 

**Allen Iverson** is undraftable/unplayable. For a quick example, his 02-03 season has roughly the same usage as 22-23 SGA, but with 10% lower eFG, equal AST%, higher TO%, lower REB%, lower combined STL+BLK%, and lower FT% by 13%. The only thing he's better at than 22-23 SGA is that he fouls less. And SGA is only ranked about 180th in this environment. This isn't a human assigning a higher 2K rating to one player. These are his actual, real-life numbers. You could argue that his era was more inefficient, but AI actually has the lowest eFG% of all players with starter-minutes from that 02-03 season. So he was even extremely inefficient compared to his peers. Just an observation. 

**Paul George, Dikembe, Luka, Gary Payton, Embiid, Jason Kidd** are all around the same tier (~45th-55th) as either elite role players or good 2nd options on offense. If the fit is right, they can be your 2nd best player on a contender. If you get them in the 3rd, you're ecstatic. 

**Carmelo** is about 200th. He's okay as a bench player for a couple of seasons (in this context). His scoring wasn't as efficient as you'd imagine, and he wasn't good at anything else. 

**Drexler** and **Ewing** both go ~90th.

**Steve Nash** goes around 50th but his teams often perform poorly. His eFG, AST%, and TO% are all elite but man...he is a big fat negative on D and on boards. 

**Bill Walton** routinely goes around 50-60 even though he has extremely low minutes due to injury. He was that good when he did play. 

**Penny Hardaway** is about 75th all-time even though he can't contribute much due to injuries/low minutes outside of 1-2 seasons. He was also very good in the short time he was healthy. 

**Victor Oladipo** goes about 180th solely off the strength of that one good Indiana season (contributing nothing on the other 4 that you have to use him). Very strong season that stands up in a historical context. Nothing playable outside of that. 

**Brent Barry** and **Donyell Marshall** (not the washed-up version from the Cavs FYI) are both top-100 players in this format. I don't think many people understood advanced stats in that era, so people were sleeping on both of them. 

**Ben Simmons** is a top 90 player all-time in this context. Again, this can't account for him chickening out in crunch time, but I still think people forgot how good he was ~5 years ago. He is a very good player by advanced metrics. **KAT** is another example of this. He's a top-50 player of all time in this context. Again, the sim can't pick up on his ""softness"" or lack of star power in crunchtime, but I don't think people realize how good his scoring efficiency is historically (since most people look at FG%/traditional splits instead of eFG% or TS%)

Modern guys who rank higher than you'd imagine (remember, this is all-time): **Jrue Holiday** (~50), **Bam Adebayo** (~55), **Jimmy Buckets** (~55), **Draymond Green** (~65), **Al Horford** (~100), **Danny Green** (~100), **Michael Porter Jr** (~120), **Mike Conley** (~130), **Pascal Siakam** (~150). When you look at how often their teams win irl, it could be argued that they really do actually produce close to this value.

Random wing dump: **Luka** is about 50th. **Klay** is about 60th. **Gerald Wallace** is about 100th. **Ray Allen** is about 100th. **Jason Tatum** is about 120th. **Bradley Beal** is about 140th. **Paul Pierce** is about 150th. **Chris Mullin** is about 160th. **Reggie Miller** is about 200th. **T Mac** goes about 200th. **Vince Carter** goes about 200th but teams he gets drafted on have a high winning % so I think he should be top 150. 

Random PG dump: **Gary Payton** is about 50th. **Chauncey Billups** and **Deron Williams** are both about 90th. **Lowry** is about 100th. **Mark Price** goes at about 130. **Lonzo** actually goes higher (~140th) than **LaMelo** (~200th) usually. **Jose Calderon** goes about 160th, his efficiency was crazy. 

Random big dump (maybe there's a better phrase?): **Shawn Kemp** ~55th. **Ibaka** ~70th. **Jonas V** actually goes ~80th. **Amare** ~100th. **K Love** ~120. **Carlos Boozer** ~140

**Zion** goes top 200 every single time, even though he BARELY has minutes. He's that good in the few minutes he does play.  

**Tyrese Haliburton** goes ~100th in this format even though he can only contribute for 2/5 seasons and even though he hasn't hit his prime yet. He's going to be a top 40 player on this list someday. Maybe higher. **Walker Kessler** is already a stud in this format as well. 

Players in the real-life NBA top-75 who wouldn't even sniff the top-250 of this format (alphabetical by last name): **Nate Archibald, Paul Arizin, Rick Barry, Elgin Baylor, Dave Bing, Bob Cousy, Dave DeBusschere, Hal Greer, Elvin Hayes, Allen Iverson, Sam Jones, Pete Maravich, George Mikan, Earl Monroe, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Bill Sharman, Isiah Thomas, Nate Thurmond, Lenny Wilkens, Dominique Wilkins.**

Surprise guys who do make the list (all of these guys routinely get drafted, but usually not in the top 200. But all are better than some NBA Top-75 team guys in this format): **Kirk Hinrich, Patrick Beverley, Marvin Williams, Fat Lever, Gary Payton II, Charlie Ward, Joe Ingles, Taj Gibson, James Johnson, Nate McMillan, Nic Batum, Eddie Jones, Nic Claxton**

Guys who rarely get talked about on /r/NBA who are relevant in our sim-world: **Larry Nance Sr** (~60th), **Buck Williams** (~75), **Chris Boucher** (~120), **Delon Wright** (~150), **Jamario Moon** (~160), **Daniel Gafford** (~160), **Kyle O' Quinn** (~160), **Hot Rod Williams** (~200), **Tom Boerwinkle** (~200), **Bill Bridges** (~200), **Clarence Weatherspoon** (~240), **Don Buse** (~240), **Larry Sanders** (~240), **Dana Barros** (240), **Bobby Phills** (240) - most of these are elite role players. If we have our usage covered, we're looking for someone who can contribute without taking up any possessions. 

Conclusions: Obviously this isn't perfect. I am in no way saying that this is actually what these players' all-time rankings are/should be. However, I am saying we can learn something from it. Dwight is a top-10 player all-time by the numbers when you neutralize eras with per-possesion stats, and combined with his awards and accolades, I do think he absolutely should have made the top-75 team. 

I do think that we miss a lot of things with the eye-test. You probably think Ben Wallace (~35th) and Bam Adebayo (~55) are way too high on this list, and they probably are. I would also argue that we usually have them too low on our human-made lists. Look at their real-life successes. With players like these, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle of the two. Adebayo was the 1B on 2 teams that went to the finals. I do think we should consider him a lot better than we do. Not 55th best of all time good. But he's probably a more impactful player than most people realize. Similarly, while I do think that Westbrook and A.I. are top-100 players of all-time, I do think they're a little overrated. The stats back that up. 

If you are thinking ""well how can ___ be so low if his team won X games/made the finals in real life"", I will tell you that the SIM would probably come up with similar results often for most historical matchups of that player's team vs his competition, but that you're probably undervaluing certain players on those teams and overvaluing others. Again, it's not perfect and doesn't 100% reflect reality, but I think guys like Ben Wallace and Dikembe Mutombo were more valuable in the 00s than most realize. 

Anyway, if you're a big old nerd, come join us. Feel free to message me if you want to build some virtual teams as a GM and want tips/advice. There are even formats where you can draft and trade every offseason. I don't work for them or anything. Just bored and it's the offseason.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15iazbp,0.9,False,1691181100.0

598,Goat debate in Basketball,nba,"Non NBA fan, I have no clue about basket ball but I watch Football or Soccer.

Just a quick question about the NBA goat debate, online I see it’s between 2 people, Lebron James and Michael Jordan, the sentiment seems to be that Michael Jordan is still the GOAT (feel free to tell me if I’m wrong) though there are people that argue both sides.

In soccer there’s a debate between Messi and Ronaldo. Comparing both players through stats, Trophies and eye test will show that there’s a clear winner however there is still of course a debate. 

Now here’s my question, is the debate the same for basketball? What I mean is that one player is obviously better than the other but the debate exists because people can’t look past someone they idolise or is the NBA GOAT discussion more intelligent and nuanced?

There is a thread that is getting a lot of responses talking about which team is in the worst position in the league. One of the names which was brought up was the Hawks, in which many people talked about the value given up for DJM (all star tier player) had handicapped their future

This has also been a common occurrence in which people compare this trade with the Gobert trade which is...nuts.

I don't know if it's because ATL is not a popular team, or because people confuse the two because they happened close to eachother, but  can we look at some facts here?

What the Hawks gave up:
 
2025 and 2027 1st
2026 Swap
2023 1st (from NY)
Danillo Gallinari 

Ok, let's break this down: The two unprotected picks are the big value pieces here. 2025 and 2027 will likely be years into both Trae and DJ's prime years, so if everything goes well they won't be worth much. But NBA teams are always on the lookout for implosion. So that's value.

2026 swap - theoretically, what is the value here? Given the timeline of Wemby and Trae, you could say either that both teams will be around the same level (Trae + some help has proven to be a baseline of atleast 40 wins and a playoff berth the last 3 years), or you could argue that the Hawks would be better. But I'm not seeing the scenario where the Hawks are demonstrably worse to the point that this matters.

2023 1st - A pick the Hawks got from NY for Cam Reddish. Not their own pick at all. A straight up bonus which saved them from trading one down the line. A great piece to include in the deal, actually. Really hurt them I bet.

Gallo - Salary filler out of the league.

All in all, the Hawks essentially gave up 2 firsts for an all-star level player. Really emptied the clip, huh?

They kept both their 2023 and 2024 picks as well, one of which was just  used on Kobe Bufkin. 


Maybe I'm biased due to being a Hawks homer. But can someone explain what the big overwhelming cost of this deal was? Oh, and the Hawks just signed DJM to one of the best contracts in the NBA and locked him in until the end of the pick exchanges if he's not traded.

We're going to hit the 100-mark for scores with this batch of players, and I feel like that's when someone can really start making a case for a player as a Hall of Famer. It might not be a *good* case, but there is at least *a* case to be made. I don't think I've said this yet, but for reference points on scores: everyone who has a score over 250 and is eligible for the Hall of Fame is in the Hall of Fame (49 total players). There are 23 players who score between 200 and 250, and 22 of them have been inducted (95.7%). There are 36 players who score between 150 and 200, and 29 of them have been inducted (80.6%). The drop-off for inductees happens fast after that, with 53 players scoring between 100 and 150, with 26 being inducted (49.0%).

There's two ways to look at that. The first is that, since this is scored out of 1000, if a player accomplishes roughly 10-15% of what the greatest players to ever live have done, the have about a 50/50 chance of making it into the Hall of Fame. So, it makes it seem like the Hall of Fame is super easy to get into.

The other way to look at it, is that the guys at the top are so far ahead of everyone else that it's just hard to really comprehend. Oscar Robertson has a score in the 500s. If a player as exceptional as Oscar Robertson only accomplished about half as much as the very, very best of the sport, it should tell you how insanely good the very top tier of this actually is.

Something to think about while you check out today's list of names.

&amp;#x200B;

* **205. Dick McGuire - 97.0**
   * Career - 79.4
      * 1950-1960
      * NYK, DET
      * 50.9 Win Shares
      * 0.010 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 1x All-NBA Second Team Selection (1951)
      * 7x All-Star Selection (1951, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959)
      * 2.4 Finals Win Shares (3 Finals losses - 1951 NYK, 1952 NYK, 1953 NYK)
      * 0.8 Conference Finals Win Shares (1 Conf. Finals loss - 1958 DET)
   * Peak - 114.7
      * 1951-1955
   * Other achievements
      * College Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee (2006)
      * \#15 retired by the New York Knicks
   * McGuire is the only ""old-timey"" Knick to get his jersey retired. And I know most people reading this will say, ""every Knick with their jersey retired is 'old-timey'"" but I mean, *really* ""old-timey,"" like, pre-1970s title teams old-timey. McGuire led the team to three straight Finals in the early 1950s, losing to the Rochester Royals and a bunch of players I guarantee you've never heard of in 1951 (the Kings' only title!) and George Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers the next two years.
   * As of now, Dick and Al McGuire are the only pair of brothers inducted in the Hall of Fame (Dick as a player, Al as a coach.) Reggie and Cheryl Miller are also in there as siblings. (Also, this is totally unrelated, but did you know Reggie and Cheryl have another brother named Darrell who played baseball for the Angels for three seasons? Never gets mentioned.)
   * McGuire also has one of the rare ""double jersey number retirements,"" where the same jersey is retired for two different people. His jersey was retired in 1992 to go alongside Earl Monroe's, which was retired in 1986. Not counting any of the double 6's, the Blazers are the only other team to do this so far, retiring #30 for Terry Porter and Bob Gross, both in 2008.

&amp;#x200B;

* 204. Paul Seymour - 97.4
   * Career - 64.9
      * 1948, 1950-1960
      * BLB, SYR
      * 37.5 Win Shares
      * 2x All-NBA Second Team Selection (1954, 1955)
      * 3x All-Star Selection (1953, 1954, 1955)
      * 0.5 Championship Win Shares (1 title - 1955 SYR)
      * 2.0 Finals Win Shares (2 Finals losses - 1950 SYR, 1954 SYR)
      * 0.3 Conference Finals Win Shares (4 Conf. Finals losses - 1951 SYR, 1952 SYR, 1956 SYR, 1957 SYR)
   * Peak - 130.5
      * 1952-1956
   * Seymour is a perfect example of why the way the NBA keeps track of its own stats and history doesn't make sense. In 1948, Seymour played for the Baltimore Bullets of the BAA. So far, so good. In 1949, he played for the Syracuse Nationals, a team you may have heard of as they became the Philadelphia 76ers. However, in 1949, the Nationals were in the NBL, so, that season's stats/accomplishments don't count toward Seymour's totals (despite the fact that we do have at least some of those numbers.) The next year, 1950, the BAA and NBL merged to create the NBA. So, Seymour is all good again, as the Nationals are now part of the NBA.
   * So we end up with two leagues, both theoretically on equal footing (the NBL was larger and had more history, but the BAA had the East Coast), merging to form the NBA. Yet only the BAA history as counted as ""official"" by the NBA today. The Lakers and Warriors each count one of their titles from these BAA days. (If we counted the NBL titles, most of the winning teams are defunct, but the Pistons would have two more, the Kings one more, and the Lakers one more.)
   * (Just for fun, the Pistons, Lakers, Kings, Sixers, and Hawks are the surviving NBL teams today.)
   * There was a lot of backroom politicking done in the 1940s and 1950s, as to why this happened the way it did, which I won't go into here because it's long and complicated. But why we're still going along with this charade this many years later is beyond me. Either say the NBA started in 1950 (when it did, when the merger happened to form the brand-new league), or take *both* the BAA and NBL stats from before the merger and count them as legitimate. We still have time to celebrate the NBA's proper 75th anniversary in 2025!

&amp;#x200B;

* 203. Larry Nance - 97.9
   * Career - 97.9
      * 1982-1994
      * PHO, CLE
      * 109.6 Win Shares
      * 0.004 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 3x All-Star Selection (1985, 1989, 1993)
      * 1x All-Defensive First Team Selection (1989)
      * 4.1 Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1984 PHO, 1992 CLE)
   * Peak - 85.7
      * 1989-1993
   * Other achievements
      * 2x All-Defensive Second Team Selection (1992, 1993)
      * \#22 retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers
   * Nance gets hurt a bit in the ""peak"" portion of this because his All-Star selections are so spread out. He's one of the very few players who has 3+ selections, but they're not within a five-year timeframe. I wish I could give him bonus points just for being cool, but, alas.

&amp;#x200B;

* *202. Khris Middleton - 98.0*
   * Career - 71.5
      * 2013-2023
      * DET, MIL
      * 52.5 Win Shares
      * 3x All-Star Selection (2019, 2020, 2022)
      * 2.2 Championship Win Shares (1 title - 2021 MIL)
      * 1.5 Conference Finals Win Shares (1 Conf. Finals loss - 2019 MIL)
   * Peak - 124.6
      * 2018-2022
   * Other achievements
      * Olympic Gold Medalist (2020)
   * If Middleton does nothing else in his entire career, I feel like he's the perfect example of a ""not-quite-a-Hall-of-Famer."" Three All-Star Selections, one championship as the second-best player, one Olympic Gold Medal. That's really good! I don't think we can put it in the Hall of Fame, but that's really, really good!

&amp;#x200B;

* **201. Roger Brown -98.4**
   * Career - 68.6
      * 1968-1975 (ABA)
      * INA, MMS, UTS, INA
      * 65.2 ABA Win Shares
      * 0.570 Adjusted ABA MVP Award Shares (1 top five finish: 1970 - 4th)
      * 1x All-ABA First Team Selection (1971)
      * 2x All-ABA Second Team Selection (1968, 1970)
      * 4x ABA All-Star Selection (1968, 1970, 1971, 1972)
      * 8.2 ABA Championship Win Shares (3 titles - 1970 INA, 1972 INA, 1973 INA)
      * 3.9 ABA Finals Win Shares (2 Finals losses - 1969 INA, 1975 INA)
      * 2.9 ABA Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1971 INA, 1974 INA)
      * 1x ABA Playoff MVP (1970)
   * Peak - 128.2
      * 1970-1974
   * Other achievements
      * \#35 retired by the Indiana Pacers
   * Brown is the main reason I wanted to include ABA players when I did this. (Also partially Mel Daniels, also partially the first third of Dr. J's career.) He's easily the best player from the ABA to never play in the NBA. You could argue Daniels, but he did end up playing 11 games for the Nets after the merger with minimal impact.
   * Brown was banned by the NBA, as well as the NCAA, (in the same scheme that caught up Connie Hawkins) for point shaving in high school. And it's very unclear to me how much he would have actually been guilty of anything. Much like Hawkins, it seems like Brown's only crime was associating with Jack Molinas (long story short, [the guy was basically a mobster involved in all kinds of illegal things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Molinas#Match_fixing) who had previously played in the NBA). It's not like he *couldn't* have made it in the NBA, he just didn't have the option.
   * He was reinstated by the NBA after the league's merged, but he chose to not play for the NBA, either because he was older (he would've been 34 for the 1977 season) or because he was still pissed about the ban (understandable) or a combination of the two.
   * Anyway, the whole complication of figuring out ABA to NBA relative strength equations and everything is because Jack Molinas was a dick, and the NBA was terrified of even a whiff of scandal.

&amp;#x200B;

* 200. Eddie Jones - 98.6
   * Career - 90.6
      * 1995-2008
      * LAL, CHH, MIA, MEM, MIA, DAL
      * 100.6 Win Shares
      * 1x All-NBA Third Team Selection (2000)
      * 3x All-Star Selection (1997, 1998, 2000)
      * 3.6 Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1998 LAL, 2005 MIA)
   * Peak - 106.6
      * 1997-2001
   * Other achievements
      * Atlantic 10 Player of the Year (1994)
      * 3x All-Defensive Second Team Selection (1998, 1999, 2000)
   * Sometimes I wonder if the Lakers would have three-peated if they had just kept Jones and Nick Van Exel from the 1998 team. That year, the Lakers went 61-21 and lost in the Conference Finals to the Jazz. (Yes, we were *this close* to having Kobe and Jordan in the same NBA Finals. But the Bulls playing a dominant center in Shaq would've been fascinating to watch.) Shaq, Kobe, Jones, and Van Exel all made the All-Star Game that season as well, though Kobe was voted in and wouldn't have been selected without the fan vote. Anyway, the Lakers ended up trading Jones to Charlotte for Glen Rice and Van Exel to Denver for nothing, and signed a few other guys in the intervening year, but the core was still all there: Shaq, Kobe, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Robert Horry... It would have been interesting to say the least. (Van Exel was reportedly traded because he didn't like the coach at the time, Del Harris, and those Lakers had a *lot* of guards, but still.)
   * Jones also started his Lakers career wearing #25, which the Lakers retired for Gail Goodrich when he made the Hall of Fame in 1996. I have yet to find a good source on whether Jones switched to #6 of his own volition, or if it was ""strongly suggested"" to him that he change it, but the fact that he kept it the rest of his career seems like he must have been cool with it.

&amp;#x200B;

* 199. Bob Feerick - 98.7
   * Career - 62.2
      * 1947-1950
      * WSC
      * 41.7 Win Shares
      * 2x All-BAA First Team Selection (1947, 1948)
      * 1x All-BAA Second Team Selection (1949)
      * 0.1 Finals Win Shares (1 Finals loss - 1949 WSC)
      * 1.1 Conference Finals Win Shares (1 Conf. Finals loss - 1947 WSC)
   * Peak - 135.1
      * 1947-1950
   * Feerick was a finalist for the very first ""NBA Anniversary Team"" in 1971.  (He didn't make it but I don't have a lot else to say about him, so I'm going to go into this here.) This would have been the 25th Anniversary Team, where the NBA was still really trying to push the BAA founding as it's first season because the BAA guys were still around and wanted their narrative at the top. Anyway, that's why the numbering is messed up now because the 50th Anniversary Team and 75th Anniversary Team would've looked weird if they *weren't* in 1996 and then 2021, respectively.
   * The 25th Anniversary Team was done differently than either the 50th or 75th. Instead of naming the top 25 players of the first 25 years, they just did an analogue of the All-NBA team and named a First and Second Team, with active players being ineligible. Here are the results: First Team - Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman, Bill Russell, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes. Second Team - Bob Davies, Sam Jones, Paul Arizin, Joe Fulks, George Mikan.
   * Feerick and Max Zaslofsky are the only players who were [finalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_25th_Anniversary_Team#Nominees) for that team not currently in the Hall of Fame.

&amp;#x200B;

* 198. Terry Porter - 100.5
   * Career - 85.1
      * 1986-2002
      * POR, MIN, MIA, SAS
      * 110.4 Win Shares
      * 0.026 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 2x All-Star Selection (1991, 1993)
      * 6.6 Finals Win Shares (2 Finals losses - 1990 POR, 1992 POR)
      * 2.8 Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1991 POR, 2001 SAS)
   * Peak - 116.0
      * 1989-1993
   * Other achievements
      * Citizenship Award (1993)
      * \#30 retired by the Portland Trail Blazers
      * 5,000 Assist Club (7,160; 17th all-time)
   * The way I keep track of postseason win shares is I take whatever win shares the player accumulated in the postseason, then just slot them into how far his team made it during the postseason (Championship, Finals, or Conference Finals). Porter has the third most Finals Win Shares of any player who never won a title. Elgin Baylor (10.6) and Jimmy Butler (6.9) are the only players ahead of him.
   * He's actually 12th all-time in Finals Win Shares, which is kind of wild, especially since he did that in only two postseasons. The top of that list is: Jerry West, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, Wes Unseld, Shaquille O'Neal, and Jimmy Butler. Not too bad of company, honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

* 197. Bob Love - 101.1
   * Career - 70.9
      * 1967-1977
      * CIN, MIL, CHI, NYN, SEA
      * 50.4 Win Shares
      * 0.146 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 2x All-NBA Second Team Selection (1971, 1972)
      * 3x All-Star Selection (1971, 1972, 1973)
      * 1.7 Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1974 CHI, 1975 CHI)
   * Peak - 131.3
      * 1971-1975
   * Other achievements
      * EPBL Rookie of the Year (1966)
      * 3x All-Defensive Second Team Selection (1972, 1974, 1975)
      * \#10 retired by the Chicago Bulls
   * Love started his career in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, sometimes just shortened to EBL, after failing to make the Cincinnati Royals roster in 1966. This was the league that was once known as the Eastern Pennsylvania Basketball League, founded in 1946, and would later change it's name to the Continental Basketball Association, which ran until 2009. 
   * If you were a kid growing up in the 90s, the CBA was no doubt described to you as ""minor league basketball"" at one point or another. This was sort of true in the 80s and 90s, though there was never any sort of official arrangement between the leagues, it was just a *de facto* state of affairs.
   * Also, if you want to look into some seriously shady stuff, Isiah Thomas bought the league (the whole damn league, every single team) in 1999. The NBA then offered to buy the league from Thomas in 2000, who said no. The NBA then announces it's going to create its own minor league (which became the Developmental League, and later the G-League). Thomas is then offered a the head coaching job of the Pacers head coach a few months later, but due to conflict of interest rules, he can't do both, so he's forced to sell the league. He can't find a buyer in time, as the NBA is obviously no longer interested, and puts everything in a blind trust, but that obviously goes badly, the league is forced to declare bankruptcy, and most of the teams fold midway through the 2001 season. Boom, no more minor league basketball competition. David Stern, ladies and gentlemen.
   * (The CBA would try to restart with some of its original owners regaining team rights, but it only lasted a few years before finally going under for good as the Developmental League expanded.)
   * Anyway, Bob Love would go on to make the Royals roster the next year, then get drafted by the Bucks in their expansion draft, then get traded to the Bulls, where he had a huge impact for almost a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

* *196. Pascal Siakam - 101.4*
   * Career - 63.2
      * 2017-2023
      * TOR/TTR/TOR
      * 41.0 Win Shares
      * 0.017 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 1x All-NBA Second Team Selection (2020)
      * 1x All-NBA Third Team Selection (2022)
      * 2x All-Star Selection (2020, 2023)
      * 2.4 Championship Win Shares (1 title - 2019 TOR)
   * Peak - 135.8
      * 2019-2023
   * Other achievements
      * WAC Player of the Year (2016)
      * Most Improved Player (2019)
   * What exactly is ""TTR"" up above in Siakam's team listing? Why, it's the Toronto-Tampa Raptors of 2021, of course. Basketball-Reference doesn't recognize this as an official team designation, unlike the New Orleans-Oklahoma City Thunder (which is labeled as NOK for those years), but I'll never forget.

&amp;#x200B;

* **195. Tom Gola - 101.6**
   * Career - 78.9
      * 1956, 1958-1966
      * PHW/SFW, NYK
      * 52.9 Win Shares
      * 0.065 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 1x All-NBA Second Team Selection (1958)
      * 5x All-Star Selection (1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964)
      * 1.0 Championship Win Shares (1 title - 1956 PHW)
      * 1.9 Conference Finals Win Shares (3 Conf. Finals losses - 1958 PHW, 1960 PHW, 1962 PHW)
   * Peak - 124.2
      * 1958-1962
   * Other achievements
      * NIT Champion (1952)
      * NIT Most Valuable Player (1952)
      * NCAA Champion (1954)
      * NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player (1954)
      * Consensus College Player of the Year (1954)
      * College Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee (2006)
   * Gola is one of only two players to ever win an NIT, NCAA, and NBA championship. (The other is Arnie Ferrin, with Utah - NCAA in 1944 and NIT in 1947, and the Lakers in 1949 and 1950.) Gola was also the ""first alternate"" to the Olympic team in 1952, which won gold. I don't quite know how alternates for Olympic teams work, but that would be a hell of a trivia answer if he'd made the team.

&amp;#x200B;

* **194. Carl Braun - 102.8**
   * Career - 83.9
      * 1948-1950, 1953-1962
      * NYK, BOS
      * 64.3 Win Shares
      * 2x All-BAA/NBA Second Team Selection (1948, 1954)
      * 5x All-Star Selection (1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957)
      * 0.0 Championship Win Shares (1 title - 1962 BOS)
      * 0.4 Finals Win Shares (1 Finals loss - 1953 NYK)
      * 1.4 Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1949 NYK, 1950 NYK)
   * Peak - 121.7
      * 1953-1957
   * Braun was at one point the record-holder for most points in a single game, with 47, which he set during the 1948 season. 
   * He also played for the Yankees minor league teams as a pitcher for three seasons from 1947-1949, but never got called up, so switched to basketball full-time.
   * Braun also apparently invented the term ""swish,"" which sounds a little bit like Dr. Evil's father inventing the question mark, but hey, someone had to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

* 193. Mark Aguirre - 103.7
   * Career - 88.5
      * 1982-1994
      * DAL, DET, LAC
      * 67.8 Win Shares
      * 0.039 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 3x All-Star Selection (1984, 1987, 1988)
      * 2.5 Championship Win Shares (2 titles - 1989 DET, 1990 DET)
      * 2.6 Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1988 DAL, 1991 DET)
   * Peak - 118.8
      * 1987-1991
   * Other achievements
      * College Player of the Year (1980)
      * College Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee (2016)
   * Aguirre doesn't really get enough credit for being the ""missing piece"" of the Bad Boys Pistons, as they traded for him in the middle of the 1989 season and immediately won two titles. Granted, I don't know how much of that was trading for Aguirre, and how much was trading away Adrian Dantley, who Isiah Thomas apparently hated, but whatever. I'm counting it. He's really the only major player from those teams that *doesn't* have his jersey retired by the Pistons, with Thomas, Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman, Vinnie Johnson, Bill Laimbeer, and even coach Chuck Daly all having jerseys retired for them.
   * I mentioned it in Rolando Blackman's section, but it's worth reminding: Aguirre would have been on the 1980 US Olympic team that boycotted the games due to them being in the Soviet Union. I'm fairly confident they would have won gold, but we can't take anything for granted.

I'm not saying DeAndre Jordan *should* be in the Hall of Fame, I'm just saying if it's like 2050 and they're searching for candidates one year, don't be surprised if his name pops up.
   * There are also 42 players who have ever grabbed 10,000+ rebounds in their careers. Only two of them are active: DeAndre Jordan and LeBron. That really surprised me for some reason. (Andre Drummond is close at 9,963. The next closest is Kevin Love at 9,065.)

The series became tied at 2-2 and went on to 7 games.

Hakeem was coming close to the end of what would be considered one of the most perfect NBA seasons of all time, where he won MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP. He was 1st Team All Defense, averaged 3.7 blocks for the year and 4 blocks in the playoffs. With Johnson listed at 6'1 and Hakeem at 7', there was nearly a foot height difference between the two. The dunk was the epitome of the rivalry between the Suns and the Rockets during Hakeem's championship years, and captured the essence of Johnson's herculean efforts against them despite losing. Johnson would go on the next year to lose again by one point in Game 7 putting up 46 points and 10 assists, while the Rockets repeated.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15i0cho,0.85,False,1691156302.0
630,"For fans that are low/very low on De’Aaron Fox as a player and his potential, why?",nba,"De’Aaron Fox seems to be one of the most slept players in the NBA, despite leading his team alongside Sabonis to a 3 seed, being Clutch Player of the Year, an All Star and All NBA 3rd team, and nearly beating the defending champions despite an injured finger while averaging 27/5/7 with 2 steals. His career averages are 20/4/6 on 47/32/73 splits. He’s also known as a lethal midrange shooter and fantastic finisher, ranking in the top 5 in finishing around the rim pretty much every year for guards. 

Despite that, there are still plenty of fans who are quite low on Fox, saying he’s on the lower end of Top 10 Point Guards (9-10 level) or even out of the Top 10 completely. There are also fans who will say that Fox cannot be the number one option on a potential deep playoff or championship level team. 

The eye test for some prove that Fox has superstar potential and the league hasn’t seen him at his very best, while others think Fox has reached his peak and will be surpassed by peers (if not already surpassed) such as Murray, Haliburton, Garland, amongst others. All in all, Fox seems to have one of the most mysterious and polarizing opinions in the sub, some fans love him immensely while some think he’s overrated and a potential empty stats player.

640,Is it disingenuous to say Dirk and Iverson “carried” their respect teams in the 2001 NBA Finals?,nba,"I am in no way trying to discredit how great Iverson and Dirk were for their teams or how good those playoff runs were. They were clearly the superstars and #1 options.

However, I often see many people claimed that Dirk and AI absolutely just dragged a team of bums to the Finals (In Dirk’s case, winning it). 

Am I wrong to say those teams outside of Dirk and AI to be pretty solid? 

In those playoffs, the Sixers had the reigning DPOY Dikembe Mutumbo, 6MOY Aaron McKie, even COTY in Larry Brown. They also had solid enough players like Eric Snow and Tyrone Hill. They were a great defensive team. 

Of course I’m not saying they were a historical all-time team or anything and they had many flaws (including offense outside AI where he had to carry an incredible load) but I don’t think it’s fair to call them bums AI carried.

The 2011 Mavericks team is also like this to me. Dirks title run that year may be the greatest Finals run ever and on paper that Mavs team shouldn’t have lost to the Heat, creating an incredible underdog story when they sent the Big 3 packing.

However, I also think that people are doing a disservice to the team outside of Dirk. Again, definitely the superstar who was responsible for the majority of their success in the playoffs but this team is damn solid to me.

You’ve got future DPOY Tyson Chandler anchoring the defense as one of the best defensive centers in the league, an old but still good Jason Kidd who still could hold up on defense and was still an incredible passer and playmaker as a role player. Jason Terry a pretty good scoring guard, out of his prime Marion who could still defend, score and rebound. Other solid role players like Barea and Deshawn Stevenson.

Again, Dirks supporting cast in 2011 isn’t legendary or anything but I think it’s very solid.



TLDR:  think the narrative that AI and Dirk strapped on a backpack full of their teammates and dragged them to the Finals isn’t fair to the players on their respective teams.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15hs8m7,0.41,False,1691130848.0

669,How many Pelicans would it take to reasonably evacuate Zion Williamson in the event of a flood?,nba,"I am here to answer the question everyone is dying to know the answer to. TL;DR at the bottom.    
    
The official state bird of Louisiana is the brown pelican (*Pelecanus occidentalis*), so I will be using this species for my calculations. The brown pelican has an average wingspan of around 80 inches, with an average weight of around 7.5 pounds. There actually is very little information on the lifting capacity of a flying pelican, so we'll have to do some guesswork by comparing it to another species.    
    
In order to create a proper comparison, we want to eliminate unnecessarily variables. One variable that greatly contributes to the lift a bird can produce is the surface  area of its wings. Therefore, we will compare the brown pelican to a species with a similar wingspan. The bald eagle (*Haliaeetus leucocephalis*) has an average wingspan of approximately 81"", and weighs around 10lb. Males and females vary greatly in size, so I am using the average weight and wingspan of the two.    
    
So, we have determined that brown pelican and bald eagles are roughly similar in size. Per Google, bald eagles can carry around 5-6 pounds, so we'll call it 5.5. However, bald eagles are some of the strongest birds in the world, so it wouldn't make sense to assume a pelican of the same size could carry the same amount. Their muscular and skeletal structure is not built for the same kind of speed and power as that of an eagle. However, we must also consider that they are lighter than an eagle of the same wingspan, meaning they have a lower pull of gravity to overcome. So, considering all this information, and through a very scientific method of pulling numbers out of my ass (something this sub is likely familiar with), I will guess that an average pelican can lift roughly 3.247 pounds.    
     
From here on out, the math is simple: Zion's official weight, per NBA.com, is 284 lb. Divide his weight by 3.247 pounds, and we can conclude that it would take around 88 pelicans (87.5 to be more exact, but we have to round to a whole number of pelicans) to air-lift Zion out of New Orleans in the event of a catastrophic flood.    
     
But wait! This is of course ignoring the weight of the cables used to attach him to said 88 pelicans, which is very critical to our calculations. Ignoring such added weight could mean the difference between a safe rescue and sleeping with the fishes.    
    
Even 1/4"" steel rope is much too heavy, weighing 0.116 lb/ft. Instead, we will use 1/4"" nylon rope, weighing 0.0167 lb/ft. In order to have enough space for the pelicans to adequately fly, I will estimate that we will need around 40 feet of rope per pelican. That equates to 0.667 pounds per pelican. This takes our new max lifting weight per pelican (lb/pel) to 2.48. Re-doing the calculations, we now need 110.07 pelicans, which rounds up to 111. We should probably add in 5 pounds for a secure harness as well to make sure Zion doesn't fall out, plus 2 pounds of clothing to be safe, bringing our total pelican count to 117.34, or 118.    
    
However, there is one more crucial aspect we must consider: factor of safety (FoS). This is an engineering principle that expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load. This is because calculations are not always perfect, so we need to account for that error and be positive we are creating something safe. Since we are designing a flying apparatus, the usual FoS for aircraft is 1.5. However, due to the inaccurate nature and guesswork of the calculations, and the valuable nature of the asset as an NBA superstar, we will use a FoS of 2. This brings our final total to 234.68, which means **we would need 235 pelicans to evacuate Zion Williamson in the event of a flood.**

Well they're on the bench and when they return they have to play timid now. Fans robbed, competition robbed, and for what? What's the point of the limit? So one guy doesn't go crazy just Laimbeering it up all day? You could still easily do that with the limit and just send in end of bench guys for that. 

Does it even stop fouling? Is that even the aim? I'd argue the only thing effectively stopping fouling is the fact that it turns into free points. That's already a significant penalty. Free throws are the most efficient shot in the game, you don't want to give those up. Keep the team foul penalty, that is working.

But why the 6 foul limit? What's even the actual goal of that rule? How is it better for the game to have people not being able to play their hardest? What is that helping? I would bet that the amount of fouls would barely budge at all if they got rid of the limit.

The plus side? Refs lose a tool to ruin a game. Competition is about who is best not who got a bad whistle. Fans don't have to suffer the bullshit. Defense will be more aggressive, leading to more competitive games.

709,Teams Age Last Season Weighted Based on How Important That Player Was,nba,"First I calculated how many standard deviations above average a player was last season. Then I created a weighted average of a teams age based on that. This is superior to just taking a simple average of all players ages because some players are far more important and irreplaceable than others. For example, the Heat probably doesn't care that one of their garbage-time players is ancient but they do care that Butler is getting up there in age.

Center: Hakeem Olajuwon - Honorable Mentions: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal

I choose Hakeem because of his impeccable Defense. Kareem is on par with him in the blocking/contesting department but doesn't have the pick pocket skills of the Dream. Shaq's Defense doesn't come close to either of them. Offensively even though Shaq is the most ""dominant"" of them i see him as a liability when it comes to close games in the 4th quarter. He is so reliant on getting into the paint as he has no midrange scoring capabilities and is one of the worst FT shooters of all time. Hakeem has one of the deepest bags ever seen in the Post. He can burn you with his magnificent spins and beat you to the basket or punish you with his very reliant midrange scoring. Kareem is on par with Hakeem as he can get a basket at will with his infamous skyhook. Rebounding wise they are all very equal. But i choose Hakeem over Kareem as he is better on D.

Power Forward: Tim Duncan - Honorable Mentions: /

Tim Duncan is so far ahead of his competition in the PF position. He is only keen on winning and will do anything to help his team. Duncan can help Hakeem defend in the post but he is also capable of defending on the perimeter. On offense Duncan can space the Floor with his midrange scoring or go into the post. His playmaking is decent just as his general awareness and understanding of the game of basketball.

Small Forward: Larry Bird - Honorable Mentions: Scottie Pippen, Lebron James, Dennis Rodman

I know there are better SF's than Rodman or Pippen but i choose them in all-time starting 5 bc of their unselfish playstyle. Scottie is one of the greatest 2 way Players of all time. Rodman and Pippen can lockdown anyone on the court. Rodman is one of the greatest rebounders of all time and Pippen is also a great Playmaker. I won't talk about Lebron here as i start him in a different position. But at the end of the day Larry Bird is a great defender too, not as great as the other two but he can definitely hold his ground and in my lineup he doesn't have to be the best at it. Bird is here for his floor spacing, all-around scoring threat and exceptional playmaking ability.

Shooting Guard: Michael Jordan - Honorable Mentions: Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade

The Greatest Player of all Time must be in this starting 5 and it is MJ. What can i say that has not been said about him. Top 10 Defender of all time, best defender at his position, great playmaking, can take the pressure, one of the best scorer's of all time. Mike can take the last shot like no one else. He always gives his maximum effort and is great on both ends of the floor.

Point Guard: Lebron James - Honorable Mentions: Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry, Oscar Robertson

I choose Lebron at the Point. Magic is the greatest Playmaker of all time but he is a liability on defense and is less of a scoring threat than Bron. Stephen Curry has the scoring with decent playmaking and can space the floor like no one else but he is even more of a liability on D. Robertson is close to what Lebron is but is not as much of a scoring threat. He is on par with Lebron in Rebounding but James has the better passing ability. Lebron is a great Help defender and this is exactly what this team needs. MJ, TD, LB and HO can all lockdown their opponent and Bron would be there to help.

Style of play:

You have Bron and Bird being the primary playmakers, but can also score and pop off if it is needed. Duncan and Jordan are the secondary playmakers and with 4 great passers in one team you would have insane ball movement. Lebron and Bird also provide the 3 point threat to space the floor. Either of them can still go in there and get themselves high percentage looks. Jordan can shoot from anywhere inside the arc but can also finish superbly at the rim. Duncan and Hakeem can both score on their own beyond the paint. The opposing team would have a very hard time to stop this offense from scoring. On the defensive side of the game this team is even better. The worst defender to switch onto here is Lebron a 6'9 250 pound guy that can hold his own very well and is a great transitional defender. The smallest guy in this lineup is MJ at 6'6. But they are all still very athletic and cant be outpaced by a small ball lineup. Duncan in his younger days was very explosive too. Going into the paint is a Nightmare. You have to pass Duncan and Hakeem first and even if you make it Lebron comes from the back and slams your layup into outer space.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15h8s2h,0.39,False,1691080030.0

Here is my prediction for the season opener and Xmas Games:

#NBA 2023-24 Season Opener

|Time (ET)|Road| |Home|
|-:|:-|:-:|:-|
|7:00pm|Milwaukee Bucks|@|Philadelphia 76ers|
|9:30pm|Los Angeles Lakers|@|Denver Nuggets|

* Ring ceremony, of course. With the league biggest star visiting the defending champs. Would make for a good rating game. Also a WCF rematch, with trash talking between Denver coach and LeBron.
* This is the year we'll move away from the LeBron-Steph-KD-Kawhi superstar foursome as headliners. The NBA will start to shift to the international MVP trio of Giannis-Jokic-Embiid, so we'll let them headline the season opener.

&amp;nbsp;

**Premiere Week**

|Road| |Home|Remarks|
|:-|:-:|:-|:-|
|Boston Celtics|@|Miami Heat|ECF rematch|
|Sacramento Kings|@|Golden State Warriors|Game 7 rematch|

744,Between KD and Hakeem who is the more skilled player when considering offense and defense?,nba,"If we are using a 0-10 scale to rate skills, I would rate KD’s offensive skill set at a 10. There’s not many players that can do what he can do on the court. He has the ability to shoot with the best of them and drible extremely well for his size.  Defensively I would give him a rating of 6. I think he’s an above average defender. He definitely improved on the defensive side of the ball when he arrived in golden state. Overall score of 16. 

For Hakeem, his defense is probably what stands out. As a two time defensive player of the year and a 5 time NBA all defensive first team, he would have to be a 10 on that side of the ball. Offensively he was extremely skilled and gifted as well. His post game and foot work are a highlight of game. I would say he’s a solid 8 on that side of the ball. Overall score of 18. 

This might be a flawed way of rating skill levels but let me know what you guys think and who you think the more skilled player is.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15h735e,0.56,False,1691075894.0

Other players I wonder about are Dragic (37), Bismack (only 30), Gorgui Deng (33), and Taj Gibson (38) but I think all these guys have some kind of veteran presence with their last team that will keep them around.

For the Clippers, it'd be ideal if Blake could get a one year deal elsewhere so he could be brought back in the 2024-25 season on a 'retirement tour' the season the new arena opens as a ticket seller.

I would like to have Ian Eagles to replace Kevin harlan role if he retires. He exerts so much energy when he commentates and he has some catchy phrases ""OH, blah blah ON RACK ATTACK' 'HE IS NOT HUMAN' etc. He also has done amazing commentaries during nfl season like Kevin Harlan did.

758,How many rings would Shaq have won if you reversed the order of his teams?,nba,"Let’s assume all of the other players on the team remain the same and you just plug Shaq in for the same amount of years that he played with the original team 

#1993-1996 (4 yrs with Boston Celtics) 

- 1993 Celtics went 48-34 irl and lost in the first round to Charlotte. Shaq steps in as McHale/Parish play in their twilight years and makes a big impact as a rookie playing alongside Reggie Lewis. They lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Bulls in 5 games. 

- 94, 95, and 96 Celtics all won between 32 and 35 games irl. With Shaq on the squad, alongside Dee Brown, Dino Radja and an ancient Dominique Wilkins … Boston makes the playoffs these years but only wins one playoff series in the three years combined, losing to stronger teams such as Chicago, New York, and Indiana. 

#1997-2004 (8 years with the Cleveland Cavaliers)

- 97 and 98 Cavs, these teams were competent. Winning 42 and 47 games respectively, adding Shaq to a talented young core, however they cannot get past the powerhouses of Chicago, Miami and New York. 

- 99 to 2003 seasons, Shaq’s 5 season prime is wasted in Clevland. Cavs teams that won no more than 32 games in any of those years irl. Shaq is paired with Zyndruras Ilgauskas, Andre Miller, Ricky Davis and Carlos Boozer and he even drags them to the playoffs a few times. Even in a weak Eastern Conference, they are unable to win a single playoff series in this 5-year stretch, effectively wasting Shaquille’s prime. They get beat up physically by teams like Detroit and Indiana.

- 2003-04 season, everything changes when the team drafts local phenom LeBron James out of high school. Shaq and LeBron experience growing pains together but eventually the team hits their stride, even going on a 14-game winning streak late in the season. The Cavs win 46 games (35-47 irl) good for the #4 seed in the East. They sweep the 5th seeded Miami Heat in Round One and upset the 61-win #1 seed Indiana Pacers in Round 2 to meet the Detroit Pistons in the ECF. A physical series, LeBron shows his youth and Shaq is held in check by Detroit’s frontline and Detroit wins in 6 games en route to a Finals win.

#2005-2008 (3.5 years with Phoenix)

- 2004-05 season: Shaq’s contract expires with Cleveland, and they cannot afford to re-sign the aging big man. He tests free agency and lands in Phoenix with Steve Nash and Amare Stoudemire. In 2004-05 the Suns go 67-15, (62-20 irl)… Nash wins MVP and Shaq experiences a resurgence. After sweeping Memphis and Dallas, Phoenix goes toe-to-toe with the dynasty of San Antonio. The Spurs rugged defense holds Nash in check and Shaq hurts the Suns’ floor spacing. Despite having home court advantage, PHX goes down 3-2 in the series, but wins Game 6 in a 20-point blowout to force a Game 7. San Antonio prevails in OT 92-87 and goes on to win their third title in 6 years.

- 2005-06 season: Another 60-win season in PHX and they find themselves in the WCF. Only this time, the Spurs are not there. Dallas defeated SA in the second round and PHX defeats the mighty Dirk Nowitzki in 6 games and Shaq advances to the Finals for the first time in his disappointing 13 year career. Matched up with Miami, the Suns blow the doors off the Heat and win the title in 5 games. Steve Nash wins FMVP.

- 2006-07 season: Shaq is riddled with injuries and struggles with his playing weight. He plays in only 40 games, but Phoenix still wins 60 games for the third consecutive year. Unfortunately, they are matched up with San Antonio in Round 2 and once again, Duncan outduels Shaq and defeats Phoenix in a Game 7 en route to their 4th championship.

#2008 and 09 seasons (1.5 years with Miami)

- 2007-08 season: midway through the season, D’Antoni becomes frustrated with Shaq’s lack of conditioning and increasing signs of old age. Far from the dominant presence he once was, he is dealt at the trade deadline to Miami Heat to be paired with young star Dwyane Wade. The duo gels and they go 45-37, to earn the 4th seed in the East. After squeaking past his former co-star Lebron James in 7 games in Round 1, they are matched up with the 66-16 Boston Celtics who promptly defeat them in 5 games.

- 2008-09 season: Shaq plays in 75 games for the first time since the 2000 season and averages 18 points and 8 rebounds while shooting 60% from the field. Dwyane Wade ascends as a superstar, averaging 32 ppg and Miami advances to the ECF, defeating Boston in Round 2 thanks to KG being sidelined. In the ECF, they get the best of LeBron James for the second straight season to advance to the Finals, where they lose to Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in 6 games.

#2009-10 season (one year with the Lakers)

In a controversial move, Shaquille signs a one-year contract with the Lakers just two months after losing to them in the NBA Finals. Shaq showed signs of aging in the 2009 Finals as he struggled to stop Paul Gasol. Shaq accepts his role as the backup center and seeks to mentor a young Andrew Bynum. The Lakers go 58-24 (57-25 irl), Shaq averages 10 points and 7 rebounds off the bench and the team cruises through the West and eventually defeat Boston his former team, giving the Lakers their 16th championship, Kobe wins FMVP.

#2010-11 season (one year with Orlando)

Shaq is not re-signed by the Lakers, and instead goes back to the Sunshine State, signing a one year deal with Orlando. Hopes are high as the team still has much of their nucleas from a squad that made the Finals less than two years ago. Shaq comes off the bench and is happy to mentor Dwight Howard. However, one day after practice, Dwight Howard puts on a “Superman” T shirt and O’Neal demands he removes it. Howard refuses and a verbal altercation quickly tuns physical. The two have to be separated by Stan Van Gundy and Shaq abruptly announces his retirement later that week on Twitter.

&amp;#x200B;

Note : I used total points for the duo and then divided by the number of games played instead of adding the points per game for each player because for the 2002 Lakers, Shaq and Kobe scored 145 and 107 points respectively whose sum of 252 divided by 4 is exactly 63. The 2017 finals duo of LeBron and Kyrie scored 168 and 147 total points whose sum of 315 divided by 4 is also exactly 63.

If you combine the basketball reference PPG for each player, it isn't accurate as it is 36.3 + 26.8 for Shaq and Kobe which is 63.1 (0.1 more than 2017 LeBron and Kyie) but in reality they had the exact same PPG at 63.

&amp;#x200B;

Also it still blows my mind how LeBron &amp; Kyrie up such insane states and barely avoided getting swept because of a historic shooting night. The 2017 Warriors were that good. Absolutely insane offensive performances from both sides in that series.

And even more impressive is the Celtics beating a duo that dropped 70 every game! The Lakers lost so many game 7s to the Celtics despite incredible scoring from West and Baylor.

770,Top 5 lineup of all time,nba,"Name a lineup that beats this lineup below: 

PG: 2016 LeBron
SG: 1992 Micheal Jordan 
SF: 2018 Kevin Durant 
PF: 2018 Pelicans Anthony Davis (szn where he’d drop crazy stat lines)
C: 1994 or 95 Hakeem Olajuwon 

This lineup literally has it all in my opinion. 

LeBron at point has the capacity to do whatever is required from the team. Be it playmaking or scoring. 

Jordan is the ultimate closer so thats a given. 

KD is a gifted scorer and in 2018, I think he really had his best shooting season. 

AD is my choice here over KG and Duncan simply because I think he can defend both KG and Duncan, but he can also extend the floor to the 3point line unlike the other two, and he is better defensively than Dirk. (Again I’m using prime AD from the Pelicans who went god mode by himself against the Warriors)

Hakeem was an MVP who I think could easily defend any other Center including Shaq. Prime Shaq was shut down by Ben Wallace but I’m supposed to believe somehow Hakeem couldn’t do the same? Hakeem is not only bigger than Wallace, but he’s also better defensively than every other center, so I don’t see him being a liability offensively or defensively in a 5 on 5.

What lineup do you think can beat these 5 in there primes?

Edit: I’ve seen ppl adding Curry to there lineups. I’m aware that Curry would be a menace on offence, but this would be a 5 on 5 matchup amongst the greats. So who is Curry guarding on my team?

What came to my mind first was pacers-timberwolves. That team would be filthy, but there is probably a combo of even worse teams that might fit.

804,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15gmm5b,0.92,False,1691016586.0
805,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success.

Kerr being enthralled by Steph Curry, and how he excites the crowd in this game is pretty cool. Kerr was a huge fan before he ever coached him. He called the Warriors fans among the best in sports. He was also quite complimentary towards Mark Jackson's coaching.

845,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes. For example, in 2023 if Joel Embiid received 50 out of 100 first place MVP votes (i'm just making these numbers up), that would be 0.5 MVP shares. Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|

|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12.|James Harden|3.656|
|13.|Julius Erving*|3.551|
|14.|Giannis Antetokounmpo|3.511|

|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|
|25.|Charles Barkley*|2.437|




Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

I was on crutches and didn't realize I probably could've gotten some seating accomadation if I asked, so instead I hung out with my buddies STANDING the entire game behind the last row of the 300 section.

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

From 195 in 1951, and peaked at 223 pounds in 2010. It plateau'd there for several years and begun trending downward, as we can see, in 2015. In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

I'm surprised this hasn't been treated as an emergency given the way some of y'all like to ride players. But seriously, what may be causing this shrinkage?",t5_2qo4s,t3_15g5zwm,0.62,False,1690974496.0

The professional and personal rivalries that could spark from teams throwing off each others play offs due to who they pick could make for some really interesting games.

909,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

Trae in the playoffs is an inefficient chucker who is turnover prone and doesn't play defense. I continuously see him well-regarded among fans and I don't really see it. He's the exact type of high volume, empty stat player that we've seen never win anything serious as a #1 option (ie Westbrook), and his style of play doesn't lend itself to being a #2 option either since he provides nothing on the defensive end and does nothing on offense when the ball isn't in his hands. Him leading the league and volume stats (total points and total assists) doesn't change any of this. It just means he's stayed relatively healthy and has high usage.

When i was a kid, my father tried to get me into soccer but I just didn't like it (or any sport in general at the time), and so I don't really understand championships or league or seasons. Just recently at 23 y.o. I've started to grow a passion for sports, especially F1 and basketball, due to some new friends being passionate about baseball (I don't like baseball but I like the passion they put into it).

I've chosen F1 because I like cars and the technology put into it and basketball due to being a fan of Slam Dunk and liking the sport overall.

I live in Italy and here F1 is pretty easy to watch since we have many ways to see the races live and understand how it works (since it's one of the most followed sports here), but with NBA I feel I can't really grasp his mechanisms, probably due to it not being much popular here (people usually follow italian or european basketball so NBA infos are not easily obtainable).

Most of all, I don't understand if the next season starts OCT 24 (stated on the NBA official site on the Key Dates 23/24 article) or NOV 3 (as stated on the YT channel).

973,"I love Jamal Murray, but can we wait till next season to put him in the top 20?",nba,"Recency and winning bias is insane. I love Jamal Murray, Jokic, MPJ and the Nuggets. Im a Hawks fan first and I love Steph, but the Nuggets are my favorite team to watch and have been since the bubble. 

I thought Murray was underrated after the bubble when he had a really good 2020-21 season before he got hurt and people didn’t notice or care at all.  

Now that Denver has won, and Murray definitely had an incredible playoff run, people are overrating him in my opinion. 

I definitely think he’s top 25 and all star caliber no question, but I think people underestimate how hard it is to be a #1 option through the entirety of the regular season then deliver a deep playoff run as a #1 option. 

I believe Steph, Luka, Booker, Dame, Spida, Trae, Ja, Fox and Brunson, all could’ve done what Mal did last playoffs or more, production wise as a #2 option in their own way.  

But I KNOW these guys as #1 options can lead a team to the playoffs. Jamal played next to not only the best player in the NBA, but a top 20 player ALL-TIME. All those other guards I listed would benefit greatly from the spacing that the entire Denver team provides in general, not just Joker. 

They can’t afford to average 18 on okay shooting for 10 games because they don’t have guys like Jokic, MPJ, and AG to take up the slack, while Jamal has proven to be inconsistent thus far in his career in the RS. 

What he did was still amazing as a scorer and closer for Denver, but I can’t put him over those other guards until he at least puts together an All-NBA caliber regular season similar to a JB or Kyrie as a #2.

Then game 6 of the 2012 ECF happened and the rest is history.

Since that finals he won 2 more mvps, countless legendary playoff performances, won 4 championships including leading 3 different organizations with different coaches/co stars to titles and beating a 73 win team in the finals. Oh and the all time leading scorer thing.
