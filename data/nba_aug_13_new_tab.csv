1,Are wink wink deals legal? Should Harden threaten to sue Morey and the Sixers?,nba,It seems to be widely believed that Harden took a pay cut because he had a wink wink deal with Morey. But isn’t that illegal? Can Harden prove that there was such a deal and sue Morey?,t5_2qo4s,t3_15q47eg
2,Lakers believe Lonzo Ball's injuries were caused by his signature shoes,nba,"The Chicago Bulls personnel privately believe Lonzo Ball might never play in the NBA again. And Ball's first team, the Los Angeles Lakers, has a theory as to the root cause of all his injuries.

Ball has experienced lingering leg and ankle problems since the start of his career. The worst came when he had to miss the entirety of the 2022-2023 season. In addition, he's only played in more than 60 games a season once in his six-year career. At the young age of 25, he's already had to undergo three different knee surgeries. It once got so bad, Ball's knee soreness made it hard for him to walk up the stairs.

The Lakers believe all the wear and tear on his knees was caused by one thing: His Big Baller Brand signature sneakers (Zo2).


In an article by ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Paula Lavigne in 2019, Ball confirmed the Lakers were concerned about his shoes. All he told them was he'd be willing to do “just minor things” to adjust his sneakers if necessary.

Fox Sports radio host Doug Gottlieb also tweeted last May 2023, that the Lakers always believed his injuries were caused by the shoes:

“Lakers believe his initial injury, was caused by his shoes. BBB were complete trash, no R&amp;D like Nikes, just thrown together.”",t5_2qo4s,t3_15q45g4
3,How good is Klay Thompson at this point in his career?,nba,He’s still shooting 41% from 3 on 10+ attempts per game. Have the other less important parts of his games declined enough to make him *that* much worse? People talk about him as if he’s a negative on the court nowadays. He’s obviously not an All NBA caliber player anymore but just how good is he?,t5_2qo4s,t3_15q43x5
4,"Useless fact of the day: In 1996, the Charlotte Hornets drafted 2 players who would go on to have scored 50 or more points in a game: Kobe Bryant and Tony Delk.",nba,"They combined for 1 season played at Charlotte, Kobe was traded on draft night and Tony Delk was used in a deal to bring in BJ Armstrong in the summer of 1997 after 64 games played.

Also as a bonus, they drafted 2 times NBA Champion Malik Rose in the second round, who also played only 56 games for them before being released.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15q3k9r
5,Was there any point where the Kobe-Shaq Lakers could've gotten Kukoc?,nba,"I know he was listed as a 4 for most of his time in the NBA but I think Toni on those Lakers teams would've been like a supercharged version of what Rick Fox was for them, a bigger wing who could do a little bit of everything, especially pass and shoot, previous experience with the Triangle would make him even more valuable as a presence, he was still with the Bulls heading into Kobe and Shaq's first ring, so there's lots of lingering bad blood between Jerry Krause and Phil Jackson because it was only two years removed from 1998, it would've been a hard sell to work anything out if Jerry Buss and Kupchak don't do it themselves.

Edit: I'm aware he was used as an asset for the Sixers' acquisition of Mutombo but I'm sure the Lakers could've put together a similar package since they still have Eddie Jones in 99.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15q3j35
6,Just watched “Winning Time” se1 for the first time,nba,"This show is amazing! I know I’m a year behind, but I can’t say enough about how good this show is. 

The guy playing Magic is dead on. Great actor.

Adrien Brody is amazing as Pat Riley. Probably my favorite character on the show. I never knew how Riley got his start. Outstanding example of a grinder that came up from the very bottom. So cool.

The dude playing Jerry West is outstanding.

Avon from The Wire is great.

Magic’s dad is great.

The creators of the show did an excellent job of telling a story you already knew the ending to, similar to “Air”, and still keeping it entertaining.

It’s hard to tell how much of the show is embellished but if it’s halfway accurate about how close Buss was to losing it all, this has to be one of the greatest business stories in the history of the world.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15q3fwy
7,Which of these fictional teams is the best in the following categories?,nba,"Saw this graphic on a Facebook shitpost, can’t post a screenshot unfortunately.

Team 1: Kareem, Durant, CP3, Kobe, Garnett

Team 2: Duncan, Iverson, Stockton, Bron, Shaq

Team 3: Jokic, Giannis, Magic, Jordan, Dirk

Team 4: Karl Malone, Bird, Curry, Wade, Hakeem

While it’s from a Facebook shitpost, I do think they are interesting teams each with clear strengths and weaknesses. Further down are my high thoughts, would love to hear y’all’s.

Out of those teams, which has the best…


Composition/Fit:

front-court:

backcourt:

3pt shooting:

Overall shooting:

Overall offense:

interior defense:

perimeter defense:

overall defense:

team overall:

chance to win against the other teams:



My picks:

Composition/Fit: Team 1

front-court: Team 1 or 2

backcourt: 3

3pt shooting: 1 or 4

Overall shooting: 3 or 4

Overall offense: Team 1, I think the comp is great

interior defense: anyone but 3 honestly

perimeter defense: 1, maybe 3

overall defense: 1

team overall: 1

chance to win against the other teams: 1



Of course I think 1 is the best but here are my thoughts why:

Team 1: Very well constructed, excellent spacing (having a 4 in KG who can shoot the 3 I think is big with these hypothetical teams composed of players from all eras). Peak defense for all of those players is strong, one of the most talented teams overall imo.

Team 2: loses a lot of points due to fit and the defensive liability of AI and Stockton (while I think it would be good enough against most real teams, these hypothetical ones are a different story). Has the most top end talent with 3 Top 10 players all time, the spacing could be very rough - who knows though, with prime Shaq it may not matter

Team 3: very high offensive potential with this lineup (I probably underrated it above), interior D would be the question with this team. Could some combo of Giannis, Dirk, and Jokic handle prime Shaq, Hakeem, Kareem, Malone, etc

Team 4: least top end talent with imo bird being their best player but solid talent throughout. Wade would be the weak link for this team, him and curry could be defensive liabilities against some of the bigger teams. This one is weird where it has spacing (curry exists) but doesn’t with no front court without range.

Team 1 &gt; Team 3 &gt; Team 4 &gt; Team 2",t5_2qo4s,t3_15q3az0

Giannis Antetokounmpo, one of the two best players in the league, got injured early in Game 1 against Miami, leaving Milwaukee, the best team in the league, without their star player.

2022 - Jayson Tatum choked massively in the NBA Finals and Jaylen Brown struggles to dribble with his left hand. Milwaukee’s Khris Middleton also got injured in the ECSF against Boston, yet they still pushed the series to 7 games.

2021 - Kevin Durant’s toe and LA Lakers were w/o LeBron or AD.

2020 - Bubble.

2019 - Kevin Durant only played 11 minutes all series and Klay was out for 1.5 games. Plus, Kawhi was unimaginably lucky in the ECSF.

2018 - Best team of all time. Chris Paul suffered a hamstring injury in Game 6 of the WCF.

2017 - Best team of all time.

2016 - Draymond Green was suspended in game 5 of the NBA Finals.

2015 - Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injuries, on top of other injuries CLE was suffering.

2014 - San Antonio’s AC causes LeBron to cramp in game 1.

2013 - OKC traded Harden and lost Westbrook to injury in the playoffs.

2012 - Lockout season, many injuries throughout the league.

2011 - LeBron forgot how to play basketball.

2010 - In game 7 of the NBA Finals, LA took 21 4th quarter free throws, while Boston took 16 all game.

2009 - LA didn’t have to play against LeBron, who averaged 39-8-8 in the ECF. Kobe’s lowest win percentage is against LeBron.

2008 - Kevin McHale *(Celtics legend, then Minnesota Timberwolves GM)* traded Kevin Garnett to Boston. Without KG, Boston doesn’t win in 2008.

2007 - Phoenix’s Boris Diaw and Amare Stoudemire were suspended in game 5 of the WCSF.

2006 - Miami took 52 more FTs in this series than Dallas.

2005 - League expansion. Rasheed Wallace left Robert Horry open for an easy 3.

2004 - LA’s Malone (18 ppg) was injured (knee).

2003 - Dirk didn’t play in the last 3 games of the WCF because of a knee injury.

2002 - The refs gave LA an absurd 27 free throws in game 6 of the WCF.

2001 - LA lost both games to the Milwaukee Bucks, and Ray Allen has all but said that the MIL-PHI ECF was rigged so the Finals could be LAL-PHI.

2000 - LA would have lost in WCF if Portland didn’t shoot 5/23 in 4th Quarter of game 7 and blow a 15-point lead.

1999 - Lockout season.

1998 - Utah choked again in 4th Quarter of game 2. Plus, in game 6, an obvious 3-pointer by Utah’s Howard Isley was incorrectly waved off, and a later 3 by Chicago’s Ron Harper was incorrectly counted.

1997 - Utah choked in the 4th Quarter of games 5 and 6, shooting 5/32. Plus, the 3PT line was shortened.

1996 - NBA added more expansion teams, watering down Jordan’s competition. 2-time all-defense Nate McMillan’s back was in bad shape in the Finals, so he didn’t play very much. Gary Payton was not guarding Michael Jordan until the series was already 3-0 CHI. After Payton was put on MJ, Seattle went 2-1.

1995 - Michael Jordan came back late in the year, but wasn’t back to his normal self, so Houston was able to face a young and inexperienced Orlando team. Nick Anderson also missed 4 straight free throws in game 1, and if he’d made these, Orlando would have won.

1994 - Michael Jordan, the best player in the world, was off being a shit baseball player.

1993 - Chicago was able to face an offensively challenged Knicks team in the ECF and a defensively challenged Suns team in the NBA Finals. 

1992 - Arvydas Sabonis was in his prime playing overseas, and Chicago’s biggest weakness by far was the center, which Sabonis would have exploited heavily.

1991 - LA’s top scorer James Worthy and top shooter Byron Scott were both injured and couldn’t play in Game 5.

1990 - Arvydas Sabonis wasn’t playing in America yet, so Detroit didn’t have to face him when they played Portland.

1989 - Magic injured his hamstring in game 3 of the Finals, sidelining him from the rest of the series.

1988 - Isiah Thomas suffered a major ankle injury, costing him almost all of his minutes in game 7. Also, Lambier was called for a nonexistent foul on Kareem in game 6, allowing LA to extend the series to 7 games.

1987 - LA faced a horribly injured Celtics team. Plus, Len Bias was dead, and his youth would have allowed them to rest Bird more, giving them more counters to James Worthy.

1986 - Boston didn’t have to face the 62 win Los Angeles Lakers and instead had to face the young and inexperienced Houston Rockets.


1985 - Boston’s Cedric Maxwell (1981 FMVP) missed 21 games in 1985 due to knee surgery and was a shell of himself upon his return.

1984 - Lakers HOF forward Jamaal Wilkes (17 ppg) missed the 1st round with a gastrointestinal virus, which caused him to lose his starting spot and become a nonfactor. Despite this, Boston barely won in 7.

1983 - Instead of winning 4 playoff series, the 76ers only had to win 3. Plus, James Worthy got injured in the Finals.

1982 - The top 2 seeds had a bye in the first round. Obviously the fresher #1 seeded Lakers, who played 8 games pre-finals, beet the 76ers, who had played 15.

1981 - Boston faced a losing team in the Finals (40-40 Rockets)

1980 - In a trade a few years prior, Los Angeles was able to take Magic Johnson #1 overall and add him to a 47-35 team. They also won a coin flip over Chicago to get the #1 pick.

1979 - Two of the Bullets’ starters got injuries in Game 5 of the NBA Finals

1978 - Bill Walton (reigning MVP) broke his foot in Feb., Washington didn’t have to face the best team in the league

1977 - Ref strike

1950-1976 - Pre-merger

47,How will Westbrook be remembered?,nba,"I was watching the D Wade Hall of Fame speech and was so happy about his words towards Iverson. For those who watched him AI was universally loved early in his career, but as time went on became problematic in and towards the media, the league and corporate sponsors, and was seen as his career went on as a talented but troubled inefficient player. His career ended with a flame out in Memphis at 35. 

But to the (particularly black)fans and his peers he was always loved, his play style, his fashion sense, his unparalleled drive to be real and not bend to the standards pushed on him.

I thought today about how much it reflects Westbrooks arc today. 

Will the generation after look at Russ the way 2010 stars look at AI? It feels like he’s of a similar ilk where once done he’ll be that guy showing young players love, giving support and speaking from the heart.

Right now, the world would be favored heavily over Team USA.

&gt; No matter what signals the Sixers might send when it comes to trade talks, a source close to Harden reiterated that the 10-time All-Star and former MVP no longer wants to play for Philadelphia and has no plans of taking part in training camp. Does that mean he won’t report if a deal doesn’t go down by that point, or that he’ll make a messy spectacle of his training camp arrival like he did when he was trying to get out of Houston back in December of 2020? That part remains unclear, with Harden’s side still expressing a belief that there will be meaningful developments on the trade talk front before that time comes. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

&gt; As The Athletic reported in mid-July, rival executives have long been convinced that Morey was trying to keep Harden in Philadelphia. Harden asked out in late June, when his anger over how Morey handled his possible free agency led to his choice to pick up the player option for next season (worth $35.6 million) while simultaneously requesting the trade.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15pl75c

**1960s:** Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell

*Really no debate with any of these in my opinion. Weird fit with Wilt and Russell, but you don't leave either of them out*

**1970s:** Walt Frazier, John Havlicek, Rick Barry, Elvin Hayes, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

*Shafted: Nate 'Tiny' Archibald.. idk this is kind of a weird/sad decade for basketball, save for Kareem.*

**1980s:** Magic Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Moses Malone

*Shafted: Isiah Thomas, George Gervin.. this lineup feels a little small but idk who else to really swap in here. Bernard King?*

**1990s:** John Stockton, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon

*Shafted: David Robinson, Charles Barkley, Gary Payton.. Just two many great bigs in the 90s.*

**2000s:** Steve Nash, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal

*Shafted: Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd.. Too many great bigs/guards and not enough wings, thus Kobe at the 3 instead of stacking PFs.*

**2010s:** Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Dwight Howard

*Shafted: Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis.. idk this one feels pretty straightforward though.*

76,Replacement Tags for the NBA In-Season Tournament,nba,"One of the biggest questions about the In-Season Tournament proposed for next season was how to make the reward worth it for both the players and the teams. To me, it seems like this is the NBA's attempt to introduce a competition like the FA Cup in English soccer/football - a competition of smaller but still relevant importance that runs concurrently to the league itself. But this ignores part of the reason the FA Cup matters for English teams and fans.

The FA Cup holds prestige because of its history, and also because of the opportunity for smaller teams further down the English football pyramid to upset larger teams. In practice, English Premier League teams almost always win. However, due to the higher variance of soccer compared to basketball, the possibility of smaller teams upsetting larger teams always looms in the background. The fact that European soccer leagues use the point table system rather than the playoff system also helps increase the importance of cup competitions, since there is more of a separation between the competition ""types"".

So in order to mimic the effect of the FA Cup, the NBA would have to introduce teams that normally don't compete in the NBA. This could mean either foreign teams, NCAA teams, or G-League teams. However, this idea wouldn't work due to a combination of logistics, the large talent gap, and relatively low variance in basketball compared to other sports. As a result, these games would largely be meaningless, since the NBA teams likely roll over the foreign teams (assuming they play their best players and don't just play bench players).

So how to make the players and teams care? I'd like to propose the idea of replacement tags. 

One of the biggest intangibles about the playoffs is the health of the teams involved. This past year, injuries changed the trajectory of multiple playoff series. So what if the winner of the NBA Cup retained the right to replace an injured player in the playoffs? Some rules for the sake of balance:

1. Teams would only be able to use players that weren't already in the playoffs. So teams wouldn't be able to ""steal"" players from eliminated teams, only teams that didn't make the post-season in the first place.

2. Only the team that wins the NBA Cup that season gets a replacement tag. Some food for thought - do replacement tags stack? So can, for example, the Thunder win three consecutive replacement tags, then trade them for even more draft picks? Or alternatively, can the Clippers hoard multiple tags and replace both Kawhi and Paul George at the same time when they both get injured? Or do the replacement tags only apply once, to the current year's playoffs?

3. The value of the player's salary for the year would have to be less than or equal to the value of the salary being replaced. So for instance, when Herro ($5.7 million) went down, the Heat could have replaced him with somebody like Franz Wagner ($5.25 million) or Tyrese Haliburton ($4.2 million), but not someone like Paolo Banchero ($11.1 million). However, once Oladipo ($8.75 million) got hurt, then the Heat could have replaced him with someone like LaMelo ($8.6 million), or Scottie Barnes ($7.6 million).

The caveat here is that the player being replaced cannot be subbed back in. So if Herro could have played in the Finals, as was being suggested at the time, do the Heat replace him right away, or gamble on his health? 

What issues does this introduce to the team, if the player has a chance to come back, but the team replaces him anyways? 

Hypothetically, do the Heat replace Herro/Oladipo immediately, or do they hold out in case someone with a larger contract gets hurt later? 

If a player on a large contract plays consistently poorly, like Kyle Lowry, does Riley put a bullet in his kneecap to take advantage of his $28.3 million contract? This would open up a slot for DeRozan ($27.3 million) or someone to help with size, like Nikola Vucevic ($22 million) or Lauri Markannen ($16.48 million).

I believe replacement tags benefit both the team doing the ""stealing"", and the team getting its player stolen. A younger player out of the playoffs gets some playoff reps, while obviously the team doing the stealing gets a replacement for an injured player. The ""lending"" team couldn't refuse as long as the player wanted to go, and that player would qualify for a ring as well. 

So what do you all think? It would certainly introduce some gamesmanship to the playoffs if an NBA Cup winner was in it. Some other examples:

1. When Kawhi ($42.5 million) went down, the Clippers could have replaced him with Luka ($37 million), Kyrie ($38.9 million), Zach Lavine ($37 million), Brandon Ingram ($31.65 million) or Gordon Hayward ($30.1 million). All fine players.
2. Since John Wall ($47.3 million) went into the playoffs injured, the Clippers could have replaced him from day one with Bradley Beal ($43.3 million) or Damian Lillard ($42.5 million). Or any of the players above, for that matter.
3. When Chris Paul ($28.4 million) went down, the Suns could have replaced him with DeRozan ($27.3 million), Anfernee Simons ($22.3 million), or Fred VanVleet ($21.25 million). In this example, if the player coming in gets a ring, does that mean the player getting subbed out loses his? CP3 finally being on a championship winning team, getting injured, and not getting a ring as a result would certainly be a very CP3-style turn of events.

What do you guys think? I think it would be a great incentive to care about the NBA cup, since it has the potential to directly affect a team's chances of winning the title.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15pkm3u

**LeBron James** - Expanded upon Magic Johnson’s blueprint, setting the tone for the positionless basketball era. Ushered in player empowerment era, altering team-building strategy

My counter to this is, if top-level players won’t signup, that’s fine. SURELY  a few lower level players would? You can make the argument that it could actually be a great outlet for lower tier players to showcase their skills, their personality, and maybe make a name for themselves.

Here's a comparison between the two:  


**Wally Szczerbiak:**  


 14.1 - **PTS/G**

143,Guideline to the 2023 FIBA Men's Pre-Olympic Qualifiers,nba,"The 32 teams that are qualified for the FIBA World Cup are already well underway with their preparations and friendly games for the actual tournament that begins on August 25th. However, there is a lesser publicized group of 5 tournaments that are taking place across 6 countries that begins today, featuring 40 of the best national teams that *failed* to qualify for the World Cup. Here is a preview of these tournaments and a quick explanation to their purpose.

# What is the purpose of the 2023 FIBA Men's Pre-Olympic Qualifiers?

First, here's a quick rundown of how 12 teams qualify for the Olympics next summer. France gets an autobid because they are hosting, and 7 teams qualify for the Olympics through their placement at the World Cup later this month. These 7 teams are the Top 2 teams from the Americas, Top 2 teams from Europe (not including France since they already qualified), and the best finishing teams from Asia, Africa, and Oceania (basically a formality for Australia). This gets us to 8 teams at the Olympics. The last 4 teams will qualify through Olympic Qualifying Tournaments that will happen next summer, with 24 teams participating 4 sets of qualifiers next summer. Last Olympic cycle, Luka put up a [30 point triple double](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpGV2j3aw40) to win Slovenia's OQT in Lithuania to get Slovenia qualified for Tokyo. 19 of these teams will qualify to these tournaments through their placement at the World Cup (basically the best finishing teams at the World Cup who didn't qualify for the Olympics outright). This leaves us with 5 teams.

In short, these 5 tournaments will send the 5 teams needed to fill these tournaments next summer. **Basically, the 2023 Pre-Olympic Qualifiers are a last chance effort for national teams who didn't qualify for the World Cup to keep their Olympic hopes alive.** 

# Where are these tournaments happening?

The 5 tournaments are continental tournaments, with Europe getting 2 tournaments and the Americas, Africa, and Asia each getting 1. Therefore, the 5 teams that go to the Olympic qualifiers next summer will have this same continental distribution. Here are the locations and the teams participating in each tournament. For context, all the tournaments except for Asia will involve two groups of 4 teams, with the top 2 teams in each group advancing to the semifinals. After that, its single elimination. For Asia, its just a round-robin now because Chinese Taipei and South Korea pulled out.

Europe #1 - Istanbul, Turkey

* Group A - Turkey, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Iceland
* Group B - Netherlands, Croatia, Belgium, Sweden

Europe #2 - Talinn, Estonia and Gliwice, Poland

* Group A - Czech Republic, North Macedonia, Israel, Estonia
* Group B - Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina

Americas - Santiago Del Estero, Argentina

* Group A - Cuba, Argentina, Bahamas (Panama pulled out)
* Group B - Uruguay, Virgin Islands, Chile, Colombia

**Yes, believe it or not, Argentina DID NOT qualify for the World Cup after winning the Silver Medal in 2019. If you are interested,** [here are the highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=307pEFvtu4o) **to the last do or die World Cup qualifier from February in which the Dominican Republic eliminated them on home court. In short, it was an epic collapse under intense pressure. Shoutout to Jean Montero of the DR for a legendary performance that saved the DR and is now the reason we will see KAT in the Philippines.**

Africa - Lagos, Nigeria

* Group A - Senegal, Mali, Uganda, Nigeria
* Group B - DR Congo, Cameroon, Guinea, Tunisia

Asia - Damascus, Syria **(yes, you heard that right)**

* Round-Robin - India, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Syria

I wouldn't be making this post in r/nba if there weren't any notable NBA and former NBA players for their countries. Let's look at the 5 most exciting teams and their most notable players.

# Bahamas - DeAndre Ayton, Buddy Hield, Eric Gordon, Kai Jones

This is, without a doubt, the greatest FIBA squad the Bahamas has ever produced. For a country of just 400,000 people, the talent level on this team this summer is astonishing, but is also a testament to the fact that basketball is far and away the most popular sport on the islands. Buddy Hield has been a consistent presence in FIBA qualifiers for a while now for the Bahamas, but having Ayton, Gordon and Jones along with the rest of their squad consisting of college and overseas players make them the best team from a talent standpoint across these tournaments. The question is how much their lack of chemistry will hurt them going up against a more experienced Argentina team playing at home.

# Argentina - Facundo Campazzo, Luca Vildoza, Gabriel Deck, Carlos Delfino

Yes, Carlos Delfino is still playing. Coached by Timberwolves assistant Pablo Prigioni, this Argentina team has stagnated in terms of talent and the result of a poor generation of players that followed the famed Golden Generation is starting to show. Still reeling from their collapse against the Dominican Republic in February, Argentina is at its lowest point in men's basketball since the 1980s despite still ranking 4th in World Rankings. The last time they didn't participate at the World Cup was in 1982, and if they fail to qualify for Paris it would be their first Olympic absence since 2000. For a team who once reached the pinnacle of the basketball world in 2004, being at risk of their Olympic hopes getting dashed by the Bahamas is a drastic fall. Still, with players such as Facu, Vildoza and Deck still playing at the highest level of basketball in Europe, their team chemistry will make the presumed Bahamas-Argentina final game very competitive. 

# Bosnia and Herzegovina - Jusuf Nurkic, Luka Garza, Dzanan Musa

After an inspiring showing at EuroBasket last summer, this same team is adding Timberwolves bigman Luka Garza to an already talented team with two clear leaders in Jusuf Nurkic and Dzanan Musa. Nurkic is always fun to watch in FIBA because of his incredible passion he carries playing for Bosnia. This national team is always plagued with financial issues due to Bosnia's poor economy and corruption, but as long as the talent and continuity is there, they should be the favorites to advance from the Poland-Estonia tournament.

# Turkey - Alperen Sengun, Furkan Korkmaz, Onuralp Bitim, Omer Yurtseven

Rockets and Bulls fans, this squad will pique your interest. Alperen Sengun is always a pleasure to watch no matter where he is, and he is far and away the best player on this squad. However, this tournament will also be a good chance for Bulls fans to watch their new two-way player Onuralp Bitim, who has solid potential as an NBA player based off of his performances at the club level in Europe. Korkmaz and Yurtseven are still hanging on in the NBA, but its looking like their time is short unless they turn it around quickly. Turkey should be the favorite to win their tournament playing at home in Istanbul.

# Croatia - Ivica Zubac, Dario Saric, Mario Hezonja

Similar to Argentina, Croatia is at its worst point in men's basketball in a very long time. Its possibly the worst state its team has been in since the country gained independence in 1991. Despite their lack of success in recent times, the team still features some major talent, with Ivica Zubac being the star after Bojan Bogdanovic retired from international play. They are Turkey's biggest threat in the Istanbul tournament, but their lack of continuity in the past two summers will most likely continue to hurt them this summer.

152,What team are you lower on than most for this upcoming season?,nba,"Many times, the consensus completely disregards teams with tons of potential. On the flip-side, the consensus can also hype up a team that some may not think the same about. So, what team are you lower on than most? Is it a consensus playoff team that you think may miss the playoff’s entirely, similar to 2023 Dallas? Or maybe it’s a team people think will sneak into the play-in, but you still see them as a bottom feeder and top-8-ish pick in the draft that follows?

For me, my pick is Minnesota. I absolutely see the hype around McDaniels, there’s a ton to be excited about there. And Ant does have the potential to break-out even further this season. However, health was a concern last year, dual bigs of KAT and Gobert is still a joke in my eyes, Conley and Slow-mo are aging (sad to see, love both of those players) and the rest of the bench depth just isn’t there besides Naz. If Conley were to go down, do you really trust Shake or NAW as the starting floor general?

Anyway… I often laugh at how many gatekeepers there are in r/NBA comments who tell innocent or excited fans how they should act. So use this thread to have fun and just say whatever you feel. (Haters will still probably come, but at least we called it.)

(For example: For example, I think Curry would be in the top 3 talks of best to ever play the game right now if Nike’s marketing team figured out how to get him as a player. I’m always disappointed by the story Under Armour has delivered. Nike would’ve created some insane campaigns with four titles &amp; broken records.)

My breakout team are the Indiana Pacers. Not only will they make the playoffs they’re gonna be a top 4 seed in the east. Honestly they have a very well balanced rotation aside from the 4 spot.  hali, Hield, Bruce, jalen/toppin/Walker, Turner, and then bench unit led by tj mcconnel, mathurin, and nembhard. As long as most of them stay healthy I could see hali really taking the next step and maximize his teammates.

Collingwood is known as the team that everyone loves to hate due to their rabid fans and success over the last 100 years. Collingwood fans are stereotypically teethless bogans who love black and white. Enormous crowd presence in 80,000 audience + games, a rich history as one of the oldest clubs. They spend their time at the bottom at times, but generally are always challenging to play finals 5/8 years.

168,Who is a player you never got to see play that you wish you did?,nba,"For me, I’m obsessed with underrated players, and [Bernard King](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ycMJh3fj4QU) has to be the player I would love to go back in time to watch. Dude was probably one of the best baseline scorers in NBA history and doesn’t really get his due. His jumper had an insanely quick release, and to make him even more of a nightmare to guard he had probably both the deepest bag of handles and post moves in the NBA during his peak in the 80s.

So many all-time greats name him as one of their least favorite players to face because he was unstoppable as a scorer, and when the 75th Anniversary team was announced, a lot of players were surprised he wasn’t on it.

Also, the NBA hadn’t seen back to back 50 point games in over 20 years until he dropped a 50-burger on San Antonio and Dallas in back to back games, which was dubbed “The Texas Massacre,” which was also used as a nickname for him after that.

I would specifically want to go watch those two games of his.

""Despite leaving a remarkable legacy throughout his 19-year NBA career, not everyone believes Shaquille O'Neal is an absolute legend. Contrarily, not only do some not include Shaq in their top 10 all-time players list, but NBA analyst Bob Ryan even went so far as to label Shaq as overrated.


While Gary Tanguay and Jeff Goodman argued that Shaq is undoubtedly a Top-10 player on an episode of the CLNS podcast, Ryan bluntly asserted that the 15-time All-Star would be lucky if he is ranked even in the Top 15 or 20 players in league history.


'Not for me,' Ryan’s responded to claims that Shaq places in the Top 10. 'He’s 15 to 20 if he’s lucky. I mean, he’s overrated...Shaq is indifferent to rebounding. He never led the league in rebounding. That’s just an amazing thing.'""",t5_2qo4s,t3_15ovnnl

He's also the most turnover prone out of the guys here and physical defenders are really having an effect on him in the playoffs (last year celtics, this year nuggets).

176,"Do you think Dame's trade situation will end up like Kobe's, KD's or Harden/Ben Simmons?",nba,"Given recent trades of superstars, we know that one thing is certain. If a superstar wants to leave, they will have their way, eventually. That said, which of these scenarios will the Lillard trade saga likely look like?

1. KD-type trade: Superstar asks for a trade in the summer. It gets ugly at moments (e.g. KD asking for the coach and GM to be fired, Dame's agent memo to teams warning them to not trade for an unhappy superstar). Ultimately, at some point, the front office and player have a short-term reconciliation (or truce probably more accurately describes it) and decide to go into the season committed (at least in the short-term). However, both sides agree, if/when shit hits the fan, they'll trigger a trade.
2. Kobe: Superstar asks for a trade. Very much like scenario 1, things get ugly at some point, and it seems that the superstar will actually get traded, but the team finds some out of the box trade where they can essentially get rid of Kwame Brown and replace him with prime Pau Gasol. Honestly, I think the Blazers a bit more assets than the Lakers did, and perhaps they can see if a team would bite on a package of Simons and Grant (though his contract probably doesn't help things). Probably would need to add Shaedon Sharpe (who the Blazers are keen on keeping).
3. Harden (or Vince Carter): Misses training camp but comes into the season. Plays well for like two games, rants in a press conference that the team sucks, plays horribly for the first 10-20 games of the season, and the team trades him.
4. Ben Simmons: Refuses to play another game with the team. ",t5_2qo4s,t3_15osme0

McGrady actually said ""being able to put a team on your shoulders and possibly get to the second round would be so great.""",nba,"If you search for the sentence ""It feels good to get into the second round,"" you'll find countless news articles and reddit threads making fun of Tracy McGrady for prematurely celebrating the Magic upsetting the Pistons after taking a 3-1 series lead in 2003.

But I noticed there was no clip of McGrady saying this, and that none of those articles were from 2003. Running a search through news archives, the [earliest match is from 2005](https://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/article/mcgrady-knows-better-now-for-nba-playoffs-1479455.php)--when Jon Barry (who was on Detroit in 2003) attributes the quote to McGrady:

&gt;Barry was with Detroit at the time and said McGrady's words were quickly passed around the Pistons' locker room.

&gt;""(Orlando) got up 3-1, and he said, 'It feels good to get in the second round,' "" Barry said. ""And it was a seven-game series. They proceeded to lose by 20 in the last three games, and we moved on. He's heard about it from me a few times.""

So what did McCrady actually say following Game 4 in 2003? [Here](https://i.imgur.com/7TUIP9E.png) is the article quoting him at the time, and [here](https://i.imgur.com/H9ISOtS.png) is McGrady's quote:

&gt;Knocked out of the playoffs in the first round the past three seasons, McGrady hungers for the validation a series victory would provide.

&gt;**""Being a young guy in this league and being able to put a team on your shoulders and possibly get to the second round would be so great,"" McGrady said. ""I've been bounced out so many times and it's left a bad taste in my mouth.""**

Other [post-game recaps](https://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/article/magic-take-3-1-lead-on-misfiring-pistons-2113535.php) from after game 4 also have McGrady being more cautious than he's now portrayed:

&gt; Orlando last advanced past the opening round in 1996 -- when it swept Detroit -- and has dropped four series since. McGrady has exited in the first round three straight times, the first with Toronto and then two more after coming home to central Florida.
&gt; 
&gt; All those trends can all be undone with a Magic victory in Detroit on Wednesday -- but not until then.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Our guys are just keeping their composure, going out here focused and playing with a great deal of confidence -- and that what we're going to need to close out this series,"" said McGrady, averaging 36.3 points against Detroit.

248,David Robinson deserves a lot more respect and recognition for the 1999 title run.,nba," 

Now to start off, let me say this: I'm not saying David Robinson is better than Duncan (obviously not), but it seems to me that the younger generation seems to think that Duncan carried the Spurs on his back.

No, 1999 David Robinson was still a very good player.

1. He averaged 16 ppg on .500 shooting. At first glance, this doesn't look like very good numbers for a former MVP, especially a C, but David Robinson at this point, was playing second option to Duncan on offense. The Spurs were a low-scoring team and 16 was second-best. Duncan himself averaged ""only"" 22, while playing 8 mpg more. .500 shooting looks horrid for a C, but if you have actually seen David Robinson played, you know he operates a lot outside the paint as well. Duncan himself had a similar shooting percentage. Plus in 1999, shooting percentages across the league tanked. I won't say he was a beast on the offensive end (as he used to be), but I think he was an elite #2.
2. Still a defensive beast. 10 rpg is always decent. Duncan was averaging 11.5 Averaged just 0.2 bpg lesser than Duncan despite playing a full 8mpg lesser. Averaged 1.5 spg (way more than Duncan) and for a big man, 1.5 spg is damn good.

TLDR: I hate it when people seem to believe that David Robinson was just along for the ride for both his titles. Maybe the 2003 title but the 1999 title? He clearly still has plenty left in the tank and showed.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15oddeo

263,The Fellowship of the Ring as NBA players,nba,"1. **Frodo Baggins - Stephen Curry 
   Just like Frodo, Stephen Curry is a true leader and has a knack for carrying the weight of his team on his shoulders. Both possess an uncanny ability to rise to the occasion when the pressure is on, whether it's sinking a clutch three-pointer or shooting the One Ring to Mount Doom.

2. **Samwise Gamgee - Draymond Green 
   Samwise's loyalty and determination remind us of Draymond Green's role as the heart and soul of the Warriors. Both are fiercely protective of their friends and teammates, willing to do whatever it takes to support their team, whether it's protecting Frodo or facilitating plays on the court.

3. **Aragorn - LeBron James 
   
Aragorn's leadership, charisma, and undeniable skill make him the LeBron James of Middle-earth. Both have a way of inspiring those around them to achieve greatness and lead by example. Plus, they both know how to make a triumphant return to their rightful place (returning to Gondor and returning to Cleveland).

4. **Legolas - Klay Thompson
   Legolas' exceptional archery skills are matched by Klay Thompson's incredible shooting ability. Both have a calm and collected demeanor, often making the difficult look effortless. Whether it's sinking three-pointers or shooting arrows with pinpoint accuracy, Legolas and Klay are precision masters.

5. **Gimli - Nikola Jokic 
   
Gimli and Nikola Jokic both defy expectations with their unconventional skills. Gimli's prowess with an axe and his determination parallel Jokic's unique style of play and unselfishness on the court. Just like Gimli's loyalty to his friends, Jokic's commitment to his team shines through.

6. **Gandalf - Gregg Popovich
   Gandalf's wisdom, guidance, and strategic mind make him the Gregg Popovich of Middle-earth. Both have a way of inspiring those around them and adapting their approach based on the situation. They're the ones you turn to for sage advice and to lead the charge.

7. **Boromir - Russell Westbrook
   Boromir's passion and intensity sometimes get the best of him, just like Russell Westbrook's fiery demeanor on the court. Both have a relentless drive to succeed, even if it means taking some risks along the way. They're not afraid to play with heart and emotion.

8. Merry - Chris Paul 
   Merry's resourcefulness and ability to step up when needed reminds us of Chris Paul's leadership on and off the court. Both are known for making the right decisions at crucial moments, whether it's outwitting enemies or orchestrating plays.

We don't have to put every award to both conferences but regular season MVP is constantly discussed and often ends up with the other candidate being in the other conference.

Go to your local YMCA. Do you see guys running off screens and moving without the ball? Not really. You know what you will see? Stepbacks. Lots of stepbacks. 

The best regular  hoopers are going to emulate ball dominant isolation scorers: Kobe, Melo, Iverson, etc. Harden got passed the proverbial torch of the pickup blueprint and it couldn’t be more obvious. 

Sure Steph may have caused teams to take more threes, but they way they go about taking those threes has much more to do with Harden’s dominance than Steph’s. 

10, 20 years ago you didn’t see the pick and roll half as much as you do now. Thanks to Harden.

You didn’t even hear the phrase “gather step” until Harden revolutionized isolation scoring around the 3 point line.

Without Harden the ball dominant guards and wings of todays NBA would have a much harder time generating offense. Luka, Trae, Tatum, Mitchell, etc. Harden is the blueprint for these guys, not Steph.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15o7mj3
283,"A humble, radical proposal to eradicate free throws",nba,"As a game designer and basketball fan, I have often pondered what changes I would make to the game we all love, if given the chance. So if I were put in charge of things at the NBA tomorrow, my first rule change would be this:

Any time a player is fouled, that player receives 2 points and their team gets a fresh possession of the ball. No free throws, no over or under a team limit, doesn't matter if it's offense or defense. Somebody fouls you, you get 2 points, your team gets the ball.

This change would benefit basketball's viewing experience by eliminating its most prolific filler. In an average NBA game, you will see nearly 50 free throws per game (per BBallRef). Basketball at its best showcases movement, rhythm, flow, a unique grace. People of all shapes and sizes flying around the court, flying through the air, zipping passes to in sync teammates, launching the ball mighty distances and moving with inspiration. Stopping all that so nine players can stand around and watch one do the exact same thing 50 times totally undercuts what people love about watching basketball.

Viewers, especially casual ones, would also benefit from the removal of fouling's esoteric metagame. Extremely regularly, teams and players are incentivized to intentionally and deliberately commit fouls for a variety of reasons - stopping the clock, putting a bad shooter at the line, mitigating a fastbreak, and more. The calculus of all these situations flips completely if fouling gives your opponent 2 points and the ball. Endings of games in particular would improve, as we wouldn't have to watch the endless parade to the free throw line in the waning minutes of games - a common feature of NBA games, and a commonly cited gripe by casual basketball fans.

Now at this point you're probably saying ""Hold on, this guy is a fan of the team that employs James Harden and Joel Embiid. Of course he wants to reward foul-baiting more!"" Which, look, if I were really in charge of the NBA tomorrow, yeah I would probably just rig the whole thing for the Sixers straight up. But that's not what I'm talking about here! And really, I'm not even talking about trying to get rid of free throws with this change, I'm talking about trying to get rid of fouls.

Fouls are called fouls because they're instances where you're breaking the rules. Shoving, smacking, tackling - these are unclean actions on the basketball court. The whole point of the game is that you can't just pick up the ball and run over the guy on the other team. You can't just grab somebody's hand to prevent them from scoring. Yet current basketball rules have normalized players doing exactly that. There are “smart fouls” every game every night of the NBA season. We could prevent those situations.

If we made this change overnight, we would probably see an historic explosion of point totals. Even the worst teams in the league would threaten to score 150 points every night.

But teams would adjust. The absolute pain inflicted by committing a foul would result in those tendencies getting coached out of players quickly. Foul baiting offensive players would still go hunting for contact, but defenders would be much more hesitant to get handsy or physical. This likely results in more open opportunities, more shot attempts from the field, and more scoring - which is what we're all here to see, right?

You might say ""what about defense?"", and in fact, another effect of this rule change would actually be to increase the value of elite defensive players. The greatest stoppers and rim protectors have always done what they do without fouling. Such skills become even more of a premium when fouls become extra costly.

There would also be other ripple effects, like timeouts becoming more valuable, fewer opportunities for substitutions, and players' conditioning needing to adjust with fewer regular stoppages.

Ultimately this rule change aims to make watching basketball more approachable, by removing one of its most boring and convoluted aspects. I will leave you with two quotes, from a heckling spurs fan and then-Rocket James Harden. My hope is to one day live in a world where they are both happy.

""Nobody wants to see a free throw shooting contest.""
""Nobody wants to see fouls either, goddammit.""

284,"June 24th, 2008. ""Tell Me How My @$$ Tastes."" Shaquille O'Neal begins the era of ring culture by dropping a freestyle diss on Kobe Bryant after the 2008 Finals.",nba,"[""You know how I be, last week Kobe couldn't do without me.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lQW-FWMcBo)

After the Lakers lost to the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals, in one of the most influential (but not reported due to profanity) moments in modern NBA history, Shaquille O'Neal got up on stage at club in New York City and unleashed a freestyle rap mocking Kobe Bryant for being unable to win the NBA Finals without him.

There are of course many things that led to the modern era, but Shaq's diss, including firing strays at Patrick Ewing for having no rings as well, and leading the entire club in a chorus of ""Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes,"" led to Kobe obsessively chasing his next two rings without Shaq, which he did indeed win (though he did need the return of Phil Jackson and others).

Some have said that this era of battling between Shaq and Kobe to win without each other influenced the media to focus excessively on championship rings, and indirectly led to an entire generation of players desperately hopping teams to avoid the taste of Shaq's ass.

just like all of you, I am a big NBA fan.  I've been following it since the early 2000s (I'm so sorry I haven't been able to assist the Jordan era). 

Unfortunately, people who live outside the U.S. like me, cannot feel this passion at its best by not being able to attend live the magnificent spectacle that this sport and this league offers or we cannot meet any of our favorite players.

You know that in the last years NBA opens to play few games outside the US (Paris/London/Mexico) and Adam Silver many times talked to a possible expansion of the League in other countries. 

So my question is, do you think we will have a possibility to see a worldwide NBA league in the future? Of curse it would require many changes to the format but  is it real possible or it is just another pipe dream?",t5_2qo4s,t3_15o5i4u
289,Where do you think Kelly Oubre Jr. will end up? Will he make an impact for a contender in the upcoming season?,nba,"I know, it's easy to say make jokes and say ""Shanghai,"" ""Taiwan,"" ""Toronto"" etc. but Oubre is coming off a season in which he quietly put up **20.3** ppg, **5.2** rpg, **1.1** apg on could-be-worse efficiency for a terrible Hornets team.

Like fellow mid-August free agent Christian Wood, he's known as an offense-first ball stopper. Unlike Wood, he's not considered a headcase and has never played on a good team. I'm surprised there hasn't been more of a market for him.

I could still see him ending up with a few playoff hopefuls:

**Mavericks:** This could be the ideal landing spot for Oubre, who becomes the third option on a contender that's trying to zag where others zig, putting ball-dominant scorers around their star like the Lakers did with LeBron in his first season there.

**Pacers:** That team has an unselfish point guard but needs anyone who can play forward. Oubre would immediately become the best-looking person to ever hold Indiana residency.

**Bucks:** They need a spark, and his selfish tendencies would likely be ironed out within one of the league's best team cultures. 

**Grizzlies:** They have Ziaire Williams and David Roddy to fill the void left by Dillon Brooks, but adding Oubre would let them play big and have another scorer during Ja's suspension. Might be too many cooks in the kitchen, though.

**76ers**: Depending on what happens with Harden, they're also thin at the wings and might need another scorer to play off of Embiid and Maxey. I think this would require Oubre signing for the minimum, but it seems like there's no market for the dude right now.

He as incredibly reliable when he player - if there was a big shot, he would hit it, if there was a highlight pass, he was in it.  He could hit the 3, breakdown defenders off the dribble, intiiate the offense and make the perfect backdoor pass.

My favorite personally Is actually when Jeremy Lin Was a bad player and about 2 days or 1 day before contracts expires day and Jeremy lin was worried he was gonna have a roster spot after this day and of course no one is gonna sign someone that couldn't play for the Knicks. But happily There was a game between the Knicks vs Lakers So Jeremy Could have a chance to prove himself. In the game he went off scoring in creative ways And then In the 4th quarter Kobe Bryant said ""You had a great game"" Everyone was confused cause there's 12 minutes left. And then in the 4th quarter Kobe went off also. Then when the game was finished Jeremy scored 38 points and Kobe scoring 34, So that game right there saved Jeremys career.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15o0iok

296,"If past NBA Players were picked up by the Delorean from Back To The Future during their prime and they were dropped into the NBA in 2023, who would be successful and who would not?",nba,"I'm curious about this. The game has changed a lot throughout the years. If the Delorean picked up some of them up during their prime and they dropped them in the NBA in 2023, the results would definitely vary. Some players might be successful but some wouldn't.

Who do you think would be successful in the NBA today? Who wouldn't be successful? I'll try to make guesses myself. I'll try to be as objective as possible. Feel free to add players to the discussion as well.

1. Bill Russell: Success - His Defense, Basketball IQ, Positioning and Rebounding are off the charts. He's also a decent playmaker and had good touch around the rim. He would be a much better version of Rudy Gobert but unlike Gobert, he could score in the paint and he wouldn't be a liability on offense. He would be a defensive monster like Brook Lopez or Gobert who could pass out of the post and score from the painted area. He would also be way more athletic and mobile than these two guys.
2. Larry Bird: Success - He would be  on the same level Luka and The Joker (or possibly even above them) but with much better shooting. He wouldn't be a defensive liability who you'd need to hide. Luka and Jokic aren't elite on defense but they're serviceable. Larry Bird would be the same.
3. Jerry West: Success (but not as a three point shooter) - Jerry West was a good shooter but based on his highlights, he didn't take any shots from three-point range. There wasn't a three point line during his time but if you drew an imaginary three point line during his playing days, his shots would probably come from mid-range or the top of the key at the furthest. He was elite on defense though. I think he would be like Jimmy Butler. Just like Jimmy, he can score consistently inside the 3 point line, he's tough-as-nails, he's elite on defense, but he doesn't attempt much threes.
4. Wilt Chamberlain: Success - Anyone with his physical attributes and level of skill as a Basketball player would be a success regardless of the era or nature of the game. He would be at least as good as Giannis today.
5. Bob Cousy: Flop - He could pass and dribble but he would get cooked on defense. He wasn't an efficient scorer either. He shot 37.5% for his career and he didn't have an outside shot.
6. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Success - No one from any era would be able to stop the Skyhook. Kareem also had an endless bag of tricks down low and he would dominate the NBA today at his physical peak.
7. George Gervin: Success - The Iceman could get buckets at will. His finishing around the painted area was elite, his midrange shot was good, and his touch was silky smooth. He would be like Demar DeRozan from a few seasons ago when he didn't attempt as much threes as he does now. However, I'm willing to bet that he would score more than Demar today.
8. George Mikan: Flop - He wouldn't be able to stop modern big men today. He also lacked athleticism. While he might be able to score around the post, he wasn't known for being a defensive specialist compared to other old-school centers. He wouldn't do well if he was plucked straight from his time.
9. Dr. J: Success - No one could really shut him down. He was one of those guys who could get to the paint at will no matter who you put on him. He would be at least as good as SGA when it comes to having the ability to get into the paint. In addition to this, he would be at least as good as Ja Morant in terms of athletic ability and finishing at the rim.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15nxx4b

299,"If Wembanyama's career ended up like Gobert's, would he be a bust?",nba,"Rudy Gobert's career to date, age 31 and ten seasons:

* 3x DPOY 
* 6x All-Defensive First-Team 
* 1x Rebounding Leader
* 1x Blocks Leader

Accolades aside, Gobert is seen to be a key defensive anchor for every team he has played for, while being severely limited in his offensive production. He has averaged over 15 points only three times in his career. He is widely perceived to be a consistent top 30ish player in the league, although playoff shortcomings have damaged his reputation in recent seasons. If Wembanyama - a generational prospect hyped by much of sports media to be the greatest in NBA history matching or surpassing even that of LeBron/MJ - were to retire with this resume, would he be a bust?

300,Ladies and Gents of r/NBA I once again come with some Trae Young Propaganda,nba,"[https://twitter.com/HawksFanTV/status/1689707888413990912](https://twitter.com/HawksFanTV/status/1689707888413990912)

&amp;#x200B;

This young man has the same amount of playoff wins as the legendary Luka Doncic. He has led the sorry ass Hawks to three straight playoffs. He makes everyone on his team look better.

The Mavericks couldn't make the play-in, yet Luka still made the first team. 

I already know some of you are going to start talking about ""sHooTIng spLiTs""

Look at these 2021-22 Stats:

28.4 pts, 8.7 ast, 45.7% FG, 35.3% 3pts

28.4pts, 9.7ast 46% FG, 38,2% 3pts

One was first team all-nba and the other made the third team.

Now you're probably thinking ""well the Mavs wone 9 more games than the Hawks and made the Conference Finals"". This is a fair argument and I truly believe Luka deserved first team and Trae third team.

HOWEVER, I present you with these 2020-21 stats:

25.3pts, 9.4 ast, 43.8%FG, 34.3% 3pts

27.7pts, 8.6 ast, 47.9%FG, 35% 3pts

One was first team all-nba and the other did not even make the third team. May I remind you that Trae  led the Hawks to the Conference finals, beating the #1 seed in the East led by the MVP runner-up.

Also gtfoh about defense because the only star guard I know that has an above average defense is Curry and even then...

It's kinda amazing that the top 3 spots, the only ones to hit the 70-mark, belong to three guys without a ring. Understandably, they made a lot of playoff game appearances by being dueling each other and being mainstays in the eastern conference finals.

James Harden is the only one in the top echelon that hasn't made an NBA finals appearance in the last five years.

&amp;nbsp;

LeBron and the Heatles dominated 2011-14. LeBron's Cavs and Steph's Warriors dominated 2015-18. It's great to see parity in the past five years of NBA playoffs.

Was the new CBA the mark of the end of dynasties in the NBA?

It's going to be exciting to see what happens in the next 5 years.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15nr18h

325,"In 2005-06, Mike James had the most random 20+ ppg season by any player ever and was arguably a top 20 offensive player that year (-&gt; story time)",nba,"The OG Mike James of basketball went undrafted in 1998, then played in the USBL, CBA and Europe until getting a shot with the Miami Heat at age 26. He would end up playing in the NBA for 12 seasons on 11 teams.

He started his NBA career with a reputation for being a tough, defensive backup point guard with a nice outside shot but little playmaking ability. If you look at his stats, it looks a lot like many other career journeymen guards except for one big outlier season. In the 2005-06 season, at age 30, he was a top 20 offensive player in the entire league.

Flashback to Summer 2005, on the first day of training camps, Houston traded Mike James to Toronto for Skip to My Lou.

Coming off 3 straight seasons of &lt; 41% win rate under 3 different coaches, Toronto was in the midst of a massive overhaul. They'd just moved on from Vince Carter during the previous season and shifted their offseason focus on building around a 21 year old Chris Bosh. They had a glaring hole at PG and Mike had just had a solid but unexceptional 2004-05 season playing backup PG split between Milwaukee and Houston. They also signed a 24 year old rookie Jose Calderon from Spain, but bizarrely used him as a backup SG so Mike got to run the show.

Their moves didn't yield improvement to their wins (they went 27-55...ended up getting #1 pick Andrea Bargnani at the 2006 draft), but did make Toronto one of the more entertaining teams that season: 2nd ranked offense and 2nd to last ranked defense. 
At the head of that offensive explosion was Mike James. 
He started 79 games and averaged 20.3ppg, 5.8apg, on 58% TS (44% from 3) and 25% usage in 37mpg. He had a 4.0 OBPM, 7.7 offensive win shares and -0.1 defensive win shares. He ranked top 20 in the league for points, assists, EFG%, turnovers, OWS and OBPM.

-

Prior to the year with Toronto, Mike had played in 248 games across the 4  previous seasons for 5 teams and averaged 9.2 ppg, 3.5 apg on 51% TS (36% from 3) and 20% usage in 24mpg. He had accumulated 5.8 OWS, 5.5 DWS, and a 0.0 OBPM. He was on minimums his first 3 seasons and turned playing 10mpg during the championship run of the 2003-04 Pistons into a $6.5M over 2 years contract with Milwaukee.

After his breakout season in Toronto, 31 year old James was a UFA and signed a $23.5M over 4 year contract offers from Minnesota, Houston and Dallas.
He ended up signing with Minnesota because they were the only team to offer him both a Player Option in year 3 and a Trade Kicker.
Ironically, 1 year into his deal in Minnesota he was traded him back to Houston for Juwan Howard giving him a nice 15% pay bump thanks to that trade kicker. 

In his season with Minnesota he turned back into a pumpkin as he reverted back to his pre-2005 averages: 25.2mpg and put up 10.1 ppg, 3.6 apg on 53% TS and 20% usage to get 1.8 OWS, 1.1 DWS, and -0.6 OBPM for the season.

He'd go on to play 186 more games across 6 more seasons for 6 teams and never averaged double-digit points per game or a positive OBPM again.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15nq294

337,Bandwagon or not?,nba,"I've loved basketball since I was young and I've been a fan of our own national basketball league (i'm not from USA). However, growing up, I started hearing about the NBA, I was not really interested back then but eventually its influence grew in my school. Some of my friends started betting on NBA finals games, I don't want to miss out on all the fun so I joined. I remember the first time I bet on an NBA Finals game was during the first Spurs vs Heat finals matchup. The only NBA player I know back then is Kobe and LeBron since they're very popular in my country, Kobe ain't in the finals so I bet on the team where LeBron plays. I don't know him, I'm not a fan of him, I don't know everything about the NBA, I don't even watch the games, I just wait for the news lol. Next year, I started betting on some games in the playoffs, I remember I bet on the Pacers against the Heat, then bet on Spurs in the Finals. I'm not consistently betting on a single team, I just bet on any team that I feel like will win. Then another year went by and this time, I'm starting to like the NBA more rather than our national basketball league. So I started watching and exploring the NBA, then one team caught my eyes, it was the Golden State Warriors. I always love sharpshooters back then, my playstyle is more on shooting since it's been influenced not by Steph Curry, but by my fave player/sharpshooter in our national basketball league. I saw Curry and his insane shooting and how energetic and fun he plays so I instantly become a fan of him and his team. I started watching GSW games, I got hooked, and long story short, I am still a Warriors fan until now, through their ups and down. I am from overseas, the NBA is not from my country, we have our own basketball league, yet the Warriors made me love the NBA. Now I have an NBA team to always root for.

My question is, would you consider me a bandwagon? If yes, why? And if you can, please explain the conditions that should be met to get labeled as a bandwagon? If no, then why as well? I don't really care that much, I just love the NBA and GSW but part of me wants to know. I would appreciate your insights and constructive criticisms. Thank you.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15nms89

Now, I've only watched the NBA since 2015, but from my memory, Kyrie has never truly established himself as a top 10 player in the league at any point. His best statistical season was in 16-17, averaging 25/3/6/1 on 47-40-90% from the field in 72 games and he didn't make an All-NBA team that year.

- Kareem is the big one. He has went from being under Wilt/Bird/Magic for most of the 80s and 90s, to now being consensus top 3. Here's [the AP](https://www.apbr.org/oldtimrs.html) voting on the best players in NBA history in 1999, and he was under those 3 + Oscar as well. It's interesting how much his reputation has jumped over the years even though he retired almost 40 years ago 

- Oscar Robertson was voted 3rd best player. Does he even crack the top 15 in most modern lists? I don't think so. I think Westbrook kind of took the shine off Oscar's legacy a bit

379,Clarification On Trading Min Contracts With The New CBA,nba,"I'm just trying to get some clarity on the trading of min contracts. Here are the rules as I understand them:

1. Can't aggregate multiple min players together in a trade, (doesn't apply if the amount of contracts, not necessarily salary, incoming/outgoing are the same?)
2. Rule #1 doesn't apply if you are only trading min players, in which case you can trade 2 min players, (again doesn't apply if the amount of contracts, not necessarily salary, incoming/outgoing are the same?)
3. Neither Rule 1 nor Rule 2 apply between December 15th and the trade deadline, at which point you can trade as many as you want

Why have rules 1+2 if you are going to have rule 3? Why have rule 3 if you are going to have rules 1+2? Seems unnecessarily complicated. Am I reading this right?

For those that are wondering my source, it's [this article](https://theathletic.com/4607105/2023/06/28/nba-cba-new-rules/) in the Athletic that says: 

&gt; •	There will be a cap on how many minimum contracts can be thrown into a deal when that deal is done at any time except for Dec. 15 through the trade deadline. In deals outside that period, if a team is aggregating two or more salaries in a trade and getting at least one player back, and the number of contracts that team is sending out is more than the amount of players it is receiving in return, then that team cannot trade more than one minimum contract. But a team can aggregate two minimum deals if they are the only contracts the team is sending out.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15nbzlr

Also, I'm not saying Detroit will make the playoffs or anything, but I think they'll be better than last year.

Magic is typically ranked 4th all time in rankings, from casual fan rankings to network rankings including in ESPN and The Athletic’s ranking, so having Curry &gt; Magic PG wise makes it appear that people have Curry around 4th all time, considering that Magic was that great as a player and his impact and legacy combined with his talent makes him usually the 4th ranked player. 

This begs the question to people who have Curry as the best PG of all time: would you rank him 4th in place of Magic all time and how does Position Ranking differ from All Time Ranking if you don’t have him higher than Magic all time?",t5_2qo4s,t3_15n22ps

420,[O.C.] Who would have won Finals MVPs before 1969?,nba,"Possible someone has already done this here but I did a quick search &amp; couldn't find anything. I've always felt like the lack of Finals MVPs puts early players at a disadvantage when it comes to legacy conversation &amp; wanted to give them their due.

**1947 Philadelphia Warriors - Joe Fulks** We mostly only have PPG to go off of before 1955. Efficiency was very low across the league at this point but even by that standard the hall of famer Fulks was a massive shot chucker, going 4-20, 8-25 and 10-34 in games 2, 4 and 5. Fulks averaged 26.2 PPG while his second leading scorer averaged 11.4 so this really wasn't close.

**1948 Baltimore Bullets - Connie Simmons** How many of you NBA history buffs knew who Connie Simmons is? He never won any accolades while averaging 9.8 PPG for his career but the Bullets winning this series was a complete team effort &amp; Simmons was their best player, stepping up his play to put up 15.2 PPG on good efficiency for the time, while also finishing second in assists on his team. Guarantee he's the only Simmons who will ever have a Finals MVP

**1949 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** The league's first true superstar was in a class of his own at this point. Unfortunately we don't have shooting splits for every game but in two of three we do have Mikan went 14-21 and 13-20 which is out of this world for the time. He easily led both teams with 27.5 PPG and he's Mikan so he was probably averaging like 15 rebounds as well

**1950 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** Mikan upped his scoring to 32.2 this series while his team averaged just 84.5 putting this on the level of Jordan 1998. His efficiency did seem to drop off from 1949 outside of a brilliant 40 piece in game 6 but there's no doubt he was completely unstoppable

**1951 Rochester Royals - Arnie Risen** Congrats Kings fans, your team's best Finals player finally gets some recognition. They almost blew the series after going up 3-0 but the Royal's hall of fame big man was too much to overcome as he finished with averages of 21.7, 14.3 and 2.7

**1952 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** Mikan was no longer the scoring phenom of years past but he was still a fantastic all-around player putting up averages of 21.7, 17.4 and 2.4

**1953 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** For some reason they stopped tracking rebounds this series. All I know is that Mikan had 19 in game 4 but it's fairly safe to assume he was averaging his usual 15+. He also led his team in scoring once again with an inefficient 20.8 making this another easy choice.

**1954 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** The last of Mikan's 5 finals MVPs as he averaged 18.1 PPG, the only member of his team to get above 11. He added 13.1 rebounds per game for good measure. Man I wish we had more footage of this guy

**1955 Syracuse Nationals - Dolph Schayes** Led his team in both scoring and efficiency with totals of 19, 11.9 and 3. Not sure how it's possible to lead your team in efficiency shooting 39% but nevertheless he did it making him the easy choice

**1956 Philadelphia Warriors - Paul Arizin** ""Pitchin' Paul"" is one of the few players of his time who would maybe still be good nowadays as his statline of 27.6, 8 &amp; 2.8 on 43% from the field and 88% from the free throw line is still respectable. He had a wonky shooting form for sure but for the 1950's it was the smoothest jumper in the game.

**1957 Boston Celtics - Tom Heinsohn** To the surprise of absolutely nobody the legendary hall of famer who spent his entire career in Boston won Finals MVP in his rookie season, but maybe not the player you were expecting. Heinsohn averaged 24, 12.6 &amp; 2.1 on 40% shooting while Bob Cousy put up 20.7, 6.7 &amp; 9.1 on 32% shooting. You could go either way on this but at this point efficiency was rising and 32% was really ugly. Heinsohn also had one of the greatest game 7's in history putting up 37 and 23 on phenomenal efficiency while Cousy shot 2/20 yikes

**1958 Atlanta Hawks - Bob Pettit** You could make the case that Cliff Hagan was the Hawks' best player in the playoffs as a whole but for the finals Pettit stepped up when the team needed him putting up averages of 29.3, 17 &amp; 2.2 outpacing Hagan's 25.2, 9.7 &amp; 3.5. Like with the previous series the deciding game 6 was a major factor in determining this award and in that game Bob Pettit dropped 50 points and 19 rebounds, in a game the Hawks won by just 1.

**1959 Boston Celtics - Tom Heinsohn** Bill Russell set the all time record for rebounds per game in a finals series averaging a jaw-dropping 29.5 but at the end of the day you need to score the ball to win &amp; I just can't give Finals MVP to a guy who averaged a very inefficient 9.3 points per game. Once again Heinsohn was the team's best option as he led the team in both points and efficiency, putting up 24.3 on 48% shooting while pitching in a well-rounded 8.8 rebounds and 3 assists. When discussing all time greats from the early NBA nobody ever talks about Tom Heinsohn's legacy but I bet they would if he had 2 finals MVPs.

**1960 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** We're now getting into Russell's prime as he had developed into a solid offense player while still being the GOAT defender. For this series he averaged 16.7, 24.9 and 3 on solid efficiency and in typical Russell fashion he entered another level in game 7 putting up 22 points and 35 rebounds

**1961 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** Take the stats of the last series and pump them up a notch. Russell averaged 17.6, 28.8 and 4.4 although his efficiency dipped a bit. There is a case to be made for a late-career Finals MVP for Bob Cousy, who averaged 19.8, 5 &amp; 10.6 on about the same efficiency once you take free throws into account. However defensively Bill Russell is Bill Russell while Cousy was 32 at this point. 

**1962 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** One of the greatest finals series of all time. Russell averaged 22.9, 27 &amp; 5.7 on excellent efficiency while coming up huge in game 7 where he put up 30 points and 40 rebounds in a 3 point game. Were it not for that game I'd have to seriously consider the Lakers' Elgin Baylor who averaged 40.6, 17.9 &amp; 3.7 but Russell's game 7 makes this a no contest.

**1963 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** A step down from 1962 (duh), he still averaged 20, 26 &amp; 5.3 on good efficiency. 

**1964 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** This is the hardest choice of all of these. Russell had a down finals by his legendary standard averaging 11.2, 25.2 &amp; 5 while teammate Sam Jones put up an efficient 21.2, 4.4 &amp; 2.8. Jones was never known to be an elite defender but of course we don't have much footage of this series so I can't say for sure how much of a factor this was. Russell has the most well-rounded stats &amp; he played 10 more minutes per game than Jones so I want to say he'd get the award but 10 extra PPG on better efficiency is important. It's a tough call. 

**1965 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** So Bill Russell decided to shoot 70% from the field in this series. What a fascinating guy he was. You almost feel bad for the Lakers like what were they supposed to do about this? In total he averaged 17.8, 25 &amp; 5.8

**1966 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** Russell continued his high level of performance in this series averaging 23.6, 24.3 &amp; 3.7 on well over 50% shooting while coming up with 25 points and 32 rebounds in the 2-point game 7. This series puts him at 7 Finals MVPs to pass Jordan. Are we sure this guy isn't the GOAT? Wherever you rank him, his ability to come through in big moments is the biggest reason for his 11 championships and that's a quality you can't underestimate

**1967 Philadelphia 76ers - Wilt Chamberlain** We've finally reached Wilt, who had put up crazy statlines in losing efforts throughout the decade but he was only his team's 5th leading scorer this time. Still, 17.7, 28.5 &amp; 6.8 is a Finals MVP statline &amp; of the Sixers 5 17 PPG scorers he was easily the most efficient. Also it's Wilt so you know he was averaging like 9 BPG

**1968 Boston Celtics - John Havlicek** You could maybe go with Bill Russell yet again as he had a characteristic statline of 17.3, 21.8 &amp; 5.7 but unlike Sam Jones from 1964 Havlicek was another elite all around player so I have Russell losing this one off the difference in scoring. Hondo averaged 27.3, 8.7 &amp; 6.7 on similar efficiency while both players played averaged over 48 minutes per game on the series.

421,NBA Expansion/Conference Realignment,nba,"All signs point to Seattle and Las Vegas being the favorites to receive expansion franchises.  Adam Silver said they will focus on expansion after they close their next media right deals, which, ends in 2025.

Assuming Las Vegas and Seattle join the Western Conference, what team do you think would be the most logical to move to the Eastern Conference?

In my opinion, Memphis, New Orleans, and Minnesota make the most sense.

Also, does the NBA revamp the divisions with 16 teams in both conferences? Do they go back to two larger divisions or 4 4-Team divisions?

I played around with some things and like how this works geographically. Minnesota in the East here but you could swap in Memphis or New Orleans easily.

425,Where do you rank Luka's supporting cast in the West?,nba,"Mavs: Kyrie, GWilliams, Josh Green, Seth Curry, Tim Hardaway

Homers can debate about Hardy and Lively but they're both young or unproven players.

Nuggets: Murray, MPJ, Gordon, Braun (he's young but he has proven himself in the Nuggets' title run)

Grizzlies: Bane, JJJ, Adams, Smart

Kings: Sabonis or Fox (whoever you want to designate as the support player to the top player), Murray, Barnes

Suns: KD, Ayton, Beal, Gordon

Clippers: PG, Zubac, Westbrook, Powell, Mann (fluid situation, it could turn into Harden, PG and Zubac)

Warriors: Klay, Draymond, CP3, Wiggins

Lakers: AD, Rivers, DLo, Rui, Gabe Vincent

Wolves: assuming KAT is the top dog Ant, Gobert, McDaniels

The Mavs are easily 8th best, right? They're only ahead of the Clippers because of the health of PG. I'm not going to argue with you if you think the Clippers are better now or in the future if they get Harden.

Again, this is a comparison of the supporting players excluding the top dog. Luka makes such a big difference that if you include him, the Mavs will advance a few notches.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15muei4
426,What's your key NBA memory?,nba,"I was once at a Blazer game with my dad when I was really young. He would get really good tickets from his clients every once in awhile and I remember sitting close enough to the Blazers bench and I could see my favorite player of all time, Damon Stoudamire standing near the scorer's table (they were warming up still). My dad and I started yelling his name to get his attention but it was too loud in the stadium. Some folks sitting next to us noticed this and started to yell along with us. We eventually got Damon's attention and he turned around and gave us/me a headnod and a thumbs up. I'll never forget that moment. 

Right after that, a guy sitting next to us saw my excitement and claimed he had Patrick Ewing's (I think?) used armband from a game where he threw it at the crowd. He brought it out and let me see it. He then told me I could keep it. I couldn't believe it. 

Looking back on it, that's one of the best days of my life. I was maybe 8 or 9 and it was at an NBA basketball game with my dad. This is before tip-off. I think that's the magic behind sports and being a fan of the game. It's so much more than just basketball. It's the shared experience with the people we care about.

434,A team without a top 30 player but double the salary cap,nba,"Looking at past NBA champions where almost every team has at least one top guy in the league has always got me wondering how much depth would you need to edge out the front-loaded top contenders. 

Debates on top-30 aside, I think a core of say Jrue Holiday, Darius Garland, Mikal Bridges, and Jaren Jackson could already be very good. Pay each of these guys 30-40 million and at 120-160 total you would still have almost an entire second salary cap to fill out the rest of the roster with, allowing you to easily go 8-12 deep with pretty elite players. 

Assuming you can get most players within reason (not just combining every overly-valuable contract in the league, but actually paying guys what they are worth), how much depth would it take to overwhelm a team like the Nuggets who have to eventually give minutes to players like Braun and Cancar (no disrespect to them)? Could you build a contending team with no players in the top 40 or 50? Or do you think the top superstars would still outshine depth no matter what? ",t5_2qo4s,t3_15mrwcd

446,The All-Star Game Can Be Legendary,nba,"Ever since last year when Luka was mic'd up for the first few possessions and just let defenders go right by him for 3 minutes while he did an in-game interview while playing, I have been on a mission to create a truly competitive ASG environment.   It's just such a shame to waste all that talent on the court at the same time.

 I went back and watched all the ASG highlights for the past 25 seasons.  I tried to find any time people were competitive and why they were competitive.  I looked for any type of format that may have worked better than the other.  I wanted to piece together and unlock the ultimate ASG format that creates Legends, not jokes.

And so I reveal, today, the best possible ASG format to create competitiveness IMHO.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Very important 1st rule: If you play in the ASG, then you are eligible for all End of Season Awards at 64 games played instead of 65
2. There is no more drafting or Captains, this actually removes competitiveness as it creates comfortability and familiarity for the top players.  **We want to leverage a sense of unease and chips on shoulders that comes from haphazard fan voting.**
3. The 5 players who get the most votes is Team 1. 
4. The next 5 players who got the next most votes is Team 2.  So on until 4 Teams is created.
5. *The 5th team is entirely created by the coaches.*
6. After the teams are created, the NBA has an Ad campaign featuring Team 1 as the greatest 5 man team in the world and who could possibly beat them?  Use the commercial to show some of the other players from other teams and ask ""Could the coaches team win it all this year?"" at the end.
7. Sunday Night ASG.  Team 1 takes the court vs Team 2.  There is no clock aside from shot clock.
8. All shots are 1 point.  Threes are worth 2 points.  
9. *First team to score 10 points stays on the court and plays the next Team.*  
10. Teams rotate in order while the winners always stay on the floor.
11. First team to total 50 points wins the ASG. 
12. The best player of the winning team gets the Kobe Bryant Trophy
13. The other players from the winning team get the Black Mamba Legends - Medallions that go around their neck, placed on each teammate by the MVP. 

Some notes about why this would raise competition

* This will be the first time in ASG history that the top 5 vote getters would play together, and all the other teams will want to take them down.  Having that kind of power in 1 starting lineup is extremely marketable as well. 
* Winners Stay rules.  Quite simple, you want to get ASG MVP? **You want to get play time? You have to win.  You aren't just given your minutes freely by the coach.** 
* The Teams 2/3/4 will have chips on shoulders.  The Coaches team will be extra motivated to prove themselves and force other teams to play hard or they will run the table. 
* The 5 on 5 setting and winners stays rule is extremely intimate, which breeds competitiveness. 
* Tons of media heads will eat up comparing these teams before they play. Speculation and clicks will be high creating more pressure for the players to perform well

I always see these but people don't understand the concept of the percentages. The percentages mean if I were to say this take is 20% then I mean I think like 80% of people would agree with me and 20% wouldn't. 

**10%:** Lebron and Jordan are the top 2 greatest basketball players of all time

**20%:** Nikola Jokic is the best player in ball and should of won MVP but didn't because they didn't want to give him 3 in a row

**30%:** Hakeem Olajuwon is the greatest defender of all time and is a top 3 center of all time

**40%:** Michael Jordan is the GOAT

**50%:** Jordan Poole will average 27+ PPG next season and not make the all star team similiar to Bradley Beal in 2020

**60%:** People are underrating how good the Rockets off season was. Everyone is calling the FA signings woeful but its simply not true. The FVV one is especially underrated and I expect the Rockets to have an 11 seed floor and a 6 seed ceiling. Around 35-45 wins

**70%:** Players who are not very efficient and their main attribute is their scoring who also play mid defense are the most overrated players and cannot play winning basketball (Carmelo Anthony)

**80%:** Russell Westbrook is not a winning basketball player and his stats were empty in his MVP season. I think he only won because of the narrative of a TD season. (Love Russ tho)

**90%:** I think stats are easily the best indicator of how good a basketball player is and I value it heavily over the eye test

LMK what you think",t5_2qo4s,t3_15mk861
462,Josh Giddey is awesome. He needs to change.,nba," The Thunder are weird.

Their ostensible point guard and alpha dog, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, scored more than 30 points per game by dancing through and around defenders. A flamenco for a finger-roll, a salsa for a slam. He’s also the rare true-blue star guard who doesn’t really shoot from deep, which imposes unusual roster-building rules upon Oklahoma City.

Ideally, a team’s secondary stars and role players should accentuate the main character. Rising sophomore Jalen Williams, likely OKC’s second-best player already, seems to be an easy fit next to anyone. Chet Holmgren hasn’t played an NBA minute yet, but the mouthwatering *idea* of him is as a shot-obliterating, flamethrowing stretch-five, both mitigating SGA’s weaknesses and enhancing his strengths. Lu Dort needs to hit more shots, but he certainly puts up enough threes (and his defense is killer).

That leaves Josh Giddey, the 6’8” 20-year-old from Australia. Giddey, as currently constructed, doesn’t quite make sense next to SGA. Defense and shooting are arguably the most critical attributes for non-superstars, and unfortunately, Giddey is the opposite of a 3-and-D player right now.

Despite what the narrative suggests, however, Giddey’s outside shot isn’t his only concern — when he gets close to the hoop, the bugbear bites. He hit 62% of his attempts at the rim last season, a respectable number for a typical 6’4” shooting guard but a mediocre mark for a 6’8” ox masquerading as a wing. He has no problem using his size to get to the paint but seems to shy away from contact at the last minute despite acceptable free throw percentages.

Giddey averaged a paltry 1.9 free throw attempts per game, a jarring number for someone [who shot 40% of their attempts at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/21/player#tab-shooting_frequency). With SGA averaging more than ten free throw attempts per game, there might not be a lot of freebies left over, but Giddey has to be more assertive in the paint.

Although he has a solid handle, a lack of first-step burst hampers Giddey. He often creates advantages at the top of the key or on the wing that he loses by the time he gets to the rim.

Another problem: shot selection. Giddey has a good floater game when he gets to the short midrange. That’s a weapon when used judiciously, but like oversalted pot roast, Giddey sprinkles it in a little too often. Giddey’s lack of athleticism and irrational fear of contested layups results in forced teardrops, dragging down his efficiency numbers.

But Giddey’s passing is sublime. He’s easily the best table-setter on the Thunder, and he’d be a league leader in assists if he were the primary ballhandler. Despite sharing the court with SGA, he assisted on 30% of his teammates’ made shots last season, a number on par with LeBron and Giannis. He can throw the ball with either hand and utilizes an unusual variety of velocities to trick defenders and set up teammates.

It’s easy to imagine that assist number rising if Holmgren, Williams, and other teammates can help space the floor more effectively; OKC was a below-average three-point shooting team in both frequency and accuracy, which was particularly true of the starting lineup. Better shooting means more room for Giddey’s beloved bounce passes.

Giddey’s wizardry with the ball is at its best on inbounds plays. His height gives him access to more angles than most inbounders, and his daring opens up passing lanes nobody else would try. The Thunder love to run a play springing Shai free for a cut from the top of the arc to the hoop as Giddey mischievously throws it right behind an unaware defender's butt (see link in comments for an example).

Giddey is also an exceptional rebounder on both ends for his size — he has a better offensive rebounding rate than Joel Embiid and a better defensive rebounding rate than Mitchell Robinson. The defensive rebounds, in particular, are key, as they let him grab the ball and immediately push up the floor, where he’s a beast in transition.

Giddey’s defense will always be somewhat problematic. He’s 6’8” with T-rex arms, and the lack of horizontal and vertical burst limits his effectiveness both in space and at the rim. There are times when he'll contest a dunk, but he can barely even get off the ground before the ball is rattling through the hoop.

 At least Giddey doesn’t make many “business decisions” to get out of the way. He does try hard on defense, which matters, and he’s generally in the right spots at the right time. He rarely fouls, and like most great passers, Giddey can use his vision to anticipate the other team’s ball movement to get steals and deflections. He doesn’t so much jump passing lanes as lurk in them, crocodilian eyes peering out while he waits, submerged, for a foolish mistake (link in comments).

When watching Thunder games, it feels like he’s involved in more defensive plays than the numbers show. Giddey will never be a great defender, but just being big and smart is enough to ensure a baseline level of not-terribleness. He should become acceptably mediocre.

Acceptably mediocre would be a boon to his outside shot. A lot hinges on him further developing his three-point jumper. Before last season, the Thunder hired legendary shooting coach Chip Engelland away from the Spurs (and gave him a nice promotion to assistant coach). Giddey reaped the benefits. Last year’s 32.5% (on 3.1 attempts per game) doesn’t sound great on paper, but it’s a noteworthy step up from his rookie year’s 26.3% mark.

For what it’s worth, Giddey shoots it confidently, and his improvement was encouraging. Giddey doesn’t need to be a knockdown shooter, but like his defense, getting to average-ish would greatly benefit others and himself. Nearly all of Giddey’s threes were assisted; if he could become more comfortable creating one for himself, it would mitigate his lack of an initial first step and open up more driving lanes. It would also go a long way toward improving his partnership with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

I’ve been sitting here side-eyeing the pachyderm in the room while describing Giddey’s game, but the elephant is getting restless. Here’s the fundamental question that will change the direction of the Oklahoma City Thunder for the next half-decade: can Giddey and SGA play together?

This isn’t new; [I talked about it ](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/weekly-hodgepodge-deep-fakes-are)at the beginning of last year, when the answer sure looked like a resounding “no.” As of Nov 10, 2022:

* Shai w/o Giddey: +17 points per 100 possessions; 97th percentile
* Giddey w/o Shai: -12 points per 100 possessions, 7th percentile
* Both together: -16 points per 100 possessions, -infinity percentile

It was brutal! But things smoothed out as the season went on. Full-season numbers (from Cleaning the Glass) paint a slightly different picture:

* Shai w/o Giddey: +7.3 points per 100 possessions
* Giddey w/o Shai: -4.4 points per 100 possessions.
* Both together: -1.3 points per 100 possessions.

Giddey’s passing is an essential part of OKC’s offense, but it’s hard to ignore how much better the team was with him off the floor — Giddey had [the worst on/off point differential](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/21/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) of any big-minute Thunder player.

Shai got better at cutting off Giddey’s playmaking, and the team got more thoughtful about putting Giddey in spots that wouldn’t cramp SGA’s jagged drives. And the team heavily staggered Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander to ensure each got time to drive the bus.

But SGA is the engine, chassis, drivetrain, and bespoke paint job of the Thunder’s offense. For four straight years, the team has been unable to score whenever SGA is off the court, and Giddey’s passing talents haven’t been able to change that.

Improvement from the Thunder’s surrounding cast will make a big difference, particularly if Holmgren and young forward Jalen Williams can make an impact with three-point shooting.

But a -1.3 net rating isn’t good. When Giddey’s defender ignores him, Giddey needs to do *something.* A cut, a relocation along the perimeter, an off-ball screen (Draymond Green can be the inspiration here), anything to punish the defense’s temerity. 

Giddey improved at this as the season went along, and grew particularly adept at timing his cuts from the corner to the basket as Shai wove into the lane. But there's still room for growth.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the Thunder’s Moses. If they are to escape the desert, he must be the guide. It falls to everyone else to adjust their games to his idiosyncratic style. To become a part of the Thunder’s future, Giddey needs to change. He must stop settling for floaters, finish stronger, defend better, and become an outside threat.

That sounds like a lot, but let’s not forget: despite having two full seasons under his belt, Giddey can’t even order a [Great Northern](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/drink/australias-top-selling-beers-for-2022-revealed/news-story/96e0a16f27a39c0d821cb1a62f419590) for another two months. He showed substantial improvement across the board from his rookie to his sophomore season, and there are plenty of reasons to think he'll continue along the upward track. He shot 48% from the field overall in his second year, a massive improvement from the 42% he hit as a rookie.

Most of the things he struggles with can be developed. The Thunder can afford to be patient for another year to see his progress.

I am high on both Giddey and the potential of the Thunder’s core. I believe that Giddey’s exemplary passing is something every team needs, and although it hasn’t shown in the numbers yet, it should have a cascading positive effect on the offense.

But SGA is in his prime right now, and OKC has a bevy of assets for any team shopping the next disgruntled star. For all his talent, Giddey will never be the lab-grown perfect running mate next to Gilgeous-Alexander. If they can’t develop better chemistry sooner rather than later, Giddey might be packing up his hair products and moving elsewhere in 2024.

466,How would you build Team USA this year if you had to abide by the salary cap?,nba,"This was just a thought I had the other night, as I was hearing people talk about how ""bad"" the roster is for Team USA in the World Cup, but everyone on the roster is still basically a top-3 player on their own team. So, if you had to build an actual team with the NBA salary cap rules, with like actual ""backup"" level players on the team, what would it look like?

Here are the rules: Use salaries for the upcoming 2024 season. The salary cap for this year is going to be $136.021 million. The first apron level is $172.346 million, the second apron level is $182.794 million. If you go past the $136.021 million mark, you can go up to the second apron, but you have to use players that were signed using ""exceptions"" this year (midlevel, biannual, minimum, etc.) beyond that. You cannot go past the second apron.

Any G-League, college, or American players in international leagues will count as the minimum salary, which we're just going to round to $1 million. (If it helps, to stay under the salary cap, you'd need each player to average $11.3 million. To stay under the second apron, it'd need to average $15.2 million.)

For reference, here's what the current team makes:

* Paolo Banchero, Forward, Orlando Magic, $11.6 million
* Mikal Bridges, Forward, Brooklyn Nets, $21.7 million
* Jalen Brunson, Guard, New York Knicks, $26.3 million
* Anthony Edwards, Guard, Minnesota Timberwolves, $13.5 million
* Tyrese Haliburton, Guard, Indiana Pacers, $5.8 million
* Josh Hart, Guard, New York Knicks, $12.9 million
* Brandon Ingram, Forward, New Orleans Pelicans, $33.8 million
* Jaren Jackson Jr., Center, Memphis Grizzlies, $27.1 million
* Cam Johnson, Forward, Brooklyn Nets, $25.6 million
* Walker Kessler, Center, Utah Jazz, $2.8 million
* Bobby Portis, Forward, Milwaukee Bucks, $11.7 million
* Austin Reaves, Guard, Los Angeles Lakers, $12.0 million

Team total: $204.8 million (so some cuts/replacements would need to be made.)

A quick glance at the other [rosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup_squads) in the tournament looks like everyone else would definitely be under at least the second apron. Canada looks like it might be closest, but it doesn't look like the roster has been finalized, and I didn't feel like doing the math on it yet. ([Here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html) are the current salaries for quick reference.)

470,"We Love this new boom of Podcasts by Players, for Players ( PG, Gil, All the Smoke) , but can we STOP with the ""Give me your top 5 all-time"" Question? Does anyone really love those?",nba,"Without fail, the majority of interviews ask the """"Give me your top 5 all-time ...."" in the lightning round/rapid fire part and I don't understand why.  It's a lose-lose in every scenario I think can think of, if anyone likes it , I'd like to hear the appeal

1) **It's boring** \- it's a question that every single talking head debates, which, ironically , is what we hate about the talking head rhetoric the made us turn to the Player content instead.  And the concsensus is generally the same. Best shooters? Steph, Ray, Reggie, KD.  Best 2 guards ? MJ, Kobe, DWade, AI.  GOAT?  MJ, LeBron, Kareem, Russell.   The lists are ALWAYS within 80% identical.  So I don't understand what the appeal of hearing an NBA player say the exact same people that the whole world has.  

2) **It gets a Corporate response with no Value**\- Players respect other players for the most part, so they know that negativity/shade/ or omissions on their list has potential to blowback on them.  ""Hey, Give me your top 5 Power forwards"" .. ""Well, me personally, I think Karl Malone is a piece of shit, but hey..basketball stats!"".  I understand the balance between keeping it in basketball terms, but then why not just anybody with access to basketball reference....The Point of knowing an NBA players opinion is for the interesting/sometimes bias answer that comes with being in the Association.  ""Hey, Tim Duncan  is best all time, but I have him at 3 because he spit on my kid when I wasn't looking"".

I genuinely don't understand why this question is asked, especially from an NBA player, to an NBA player.  Is the thought that people want to hear this?  Id argue that in any casual or serious NBA discussion, the ""what ur top X question rarely comes up"".  Personally, I always love when ppl ask ""What was your welcome to the NBA moment?.  When did you know it was time to retire?  Who was someone that didn't get the love they deserve?  Who did you pattern your game after growing up?   Those stories are always entertaining and very personal, which is what we want from an inside players perspective. Take a page from Hot Ones on how to answer interesting and unique questions.

What do yall think?

TL;DR - Stop asking ""Who is your top 5 XXXX player"" in NBA Player Podcasts. It's boring, provides no value, is generic, and wastes the advantage of asking an NBA players their experience.

Starters - Curry, Tatum, Lebron, KD, Bam

Bench - Brunson, Booker, PG, JJJ, Chet

Reserves - Edwards, Flagg

---

Veterans (Lebron, Curry, KD, PG) as their last hurrah and be a part of something great. The first 3 defined the last generation before coming to this era of international guys. Harden would've been a legacy pick but he sucks now

Current Superstars (Tatum, Booker, Bam, Brunson) with international experience to booster the lineup. The first 2 are really the superstars then Bam is the best american C now and probanly encapsulates the modern 5. Brunson as the holdover for this year's team

Rising Stars (JJJ, Edwards, Chet, Flagg) will be the continuity of the program. Hindsight will always be 20-20 to bet on Flagg next year but basically the idea is to get the best amateur prospect. If he turns out to be an all time great, then he can even be the 2nd or 3rd best player in this lineup 20 years from now.

495,What Are Some of the Worst *Non-2016* Free Agency Signings in NBA History?,nba,"At this point, it's pretty well known and often discussed how bad much of the signings were for the 2016 offseason.  Part of that can be blamed on the massive spike in cap space but regardless, we saw a lot of awful signings that year.  Joakin Noah, Luol Deng, Nic Batum, Timofey Mozgov and Bismack Biyombo are but a few of the players we saw sign contracts for lifechanging money, even if the contracts themselves aged like milk left out in the sun.

But we're not here to talk about those signings.  We're here to talk about some of the all-time worst free agency signings outside of that infamous year.  Which ones come to mind?  

Off the top of my head, here are some of the more infamous options out there:

**Eddy Curry - $60M, 6 year contract (2005)**

Eddy Curry was sort of the precursor to Andrea Bargnani, in that he was a 7 foot center who couldn't rebound and wasn't a good defender; Curry's rebounding career high was a whopping 7 per game.  He wasn't a good shooter, his later years were marred by injury and general health issues - in his final 2 seasons with the Knicks he played **a total of 10 games** \- and yet, the start of his Knicks tenure was punctuated by a fairly substantial contract for 2005, the reasons for which that are still being studied to this day.  10M AAV back in the day when contracts could go as long as 6 years?  This is a classic ""Dolan is interfering with decision-making"" bad contract and it probably won't be the last one to pop up on this list.

Did I mention this also doubles as a classic bad Knicks trade?  Because the Knicks actually gave up assets to get Eddy via a sign and trade.

**Davis Bertans - $80M, 5 year contract (2021)**

You know what the Wizards are really good at?  Making the most out of bad contracts.  They were able to flip Davis Bertans and Spencer Dinwiddie into Kristaps Porzingus, a borderline All-Star that would net them Tyus Jones in a future trade when Tingus Pingus could have left them for nothing.  Not too shabby.  They even got a pick out of the affair!

You know who gave Davis Bertans that awful contract?  The Washington Wizards.  Probably the most recent example of a classic bad contract, Bertans was a shooter who, prior to his signing was shooting an efficient 52/41/85 on around 5 3s a game.  Sure he wasn't the best defender but he was a reliable threat from outside that helped space the floor and take some of the offensive load off Beal...

...then the 2021/22 season happened and he seemingly forgot how to shoot.  A drastic decrease in shooting to sub-36% from beyond the arc and and equally shocking drop in field goal percentage to less than 39%, the fact that Washington was able to get anything from Bertans is astonishing in its own right.  He was later dumped on the Thunder so they could move up to acquire Cason Wallace and while it's been a long time coming, this is a bad contract that will soon be off the books as his 2024/25 season has an early termination option that whomever team's he's ending up on will almost certainly take.  

$5 million is substantially less than $16 million, after all.

 **Juwan Howard - $115M, 7 year contract (1996)**

You're not going to see too many older contracts on this list and probaly even fewer in the comments section.  That's for a couple of reasons, most of which pertain to the politics of the league in its earlier days, the wacky length rookie players could be signed to before becoming unrestricted free agents rather than the 4 + QO/""whenever their extension ends or they force their way to another team"" of today, and the deck being heavily stacked in favor of ownership retaining players due to the rules at the time being best described as ""endless restricted free agency"".  A lot of that changed in the 90s and while leaving teams had a lot of stigma against it, players like Shaq jumped teams to get paid what they were worth after the team that drafted them lowballed them in free agency.

Juwan Howard...did not change teams...sort of, we'll get to the mess that happened with the signing itself, and technically his team's name did change as the Washington Bullets were renamed the Wizards later on, but in 1996 he was an unrestricted free agent and, coming off of an All-Star season where he got a 3rd Team nod, Howard was looking to get paid.  And paid he was!  

At around 16.4M AAV and locked in for 7 years, Howard peaked in his sophomore season but he wasn't bad necessarily.  He just...never became more than what he could have, and he wasn't pulling a bad team consistently into the playoffs; their peak was getting swept by the 1997 Bulls as the 8th seed.  He was your classic ""good stats, bad team"" player and though he never accomplished much as a Wizard, he can at least call himself an NBA champion as he rode the bench to a repeat via the Heatles.  The man had an absurdly long career even if he himself wasn't particularly successful but with 2 rings and a historic career earning (we'll get into that in a minute), I doubt he very much cares what you or I think of him.

The main reason why he's worth mentioning is that he was technically the first player to sign the largest contract in NBA history up to that point; the first contract in NBA history to go over $100 million, it was a contract that the Bullets/Wizards could have decided to not get into a bidding war with the Heat who offered him a more lucrative contract, albeit one that stirred some controversy at the time and that the league itself nullified due to cap rules at the time and some mishaps regarding bonuses to Tim Hardaway and P.J. Brown.  Also Alonzo Mourning had an extension at around the same time which is a part of this debacle.  The whole saga is a lot more interesting than the contract itself and it's worth a Google if you're curious about it; I didn't even touch on how Washington eventually re-signed Howard and all the implications said signing had at the time.  

This went to court.  No really, lawyers got involved.

Over who could sign Juwan Howard.

It was weird.

**Amar’e Stoudemire - $100M, 5 year contract (2010)**

Another classic bad Knicks contract though this one isn't entirely fair to New York because Stoudemire was excellent in his first year in the Garden.  25/8/2, Amar'e was still his All-Star self and even helped the team make the playoffs for the first time since 2004!  

The rest of that contract's duration?  Injuries in the later years, the loss of the late acquisition of Chauncey Billups from the prior season and an iso-heavy offense running through Melo did not do Stoudemire any favors, and did I mention the injuries?  This honestly wouldn't have been such a bad signing were it not for them but it's not like the Knicks were unaware that Amar'e could be a risky signing due to injury given some of the wear and tear from his days in Phoenix; he already had two  major surgeries on different parts of his body up to that point and his knees had the fortitude of a wet chip.

Amar'e is one of the most influential 4s of the modern era and he was integral to the revolutionary 7SoL Suns but his stint with the Knicks started out hot and cooled off very quickly.  Yet another unfortunate case where injuries robbed a truly special talent of what could have been an even more impactful and lengthy career.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15m63md

497,Was Michael Jordan’s defense and off-ball play also legendary?,nba,"I watched The Last Dance not too long ago, and recent discussions of fantastic &amp; terrible off-ball players (Steph Curry vs Trae Young), with Trae Young’s lack of defensive effort and prowess specifically being highlighted in addition to his off-ball deficiencies got me thinking.

As someone who was born and raised far past the era of MJ’s Bulls, all I really have as a reference point in regards to his basketball ability is how driven, consistently clutch, and athletically gifted he was. 

These traits most obviously translate to dominant scoring and playmaking. As a result, that’s what retrospectives such as The Last Dance tend to focus most on.

I don’t hear too much about his defensive skills, and he’s infamous for always being “the guy” with the ball in his hand. He’s always taking the last shot. That’s what the casual mainstream level of media coverage pushes in my experience, at least.

So I’m really curious, to anyone who was fortunate enough to be around during his prime, or someone with far more extensive knowledge than myself, was Jordan so well rounded to the point that even his defensive game &amp; off-ball play could qualify as the “best” in their respective categories? Do we not hear much about it because moving past screens &amp; well timed assists aren’t as sexy as dunks and buzzer beating jump shots? Or was he just mediocre in those areas, but so talented offensively it can’t be knocked too hard as a flaw? Like was he the reverse Ben Wallace?",t5_2qo4s,t3_15m4ry0
498,"What do you think are the odds that someone of average NBA height, 6'6"", who's been practicing his whole life to make it pro, actually ends up playing at least one professional basketball game?",nba,"Am I crazy to think the odds are pretty high like 40%? Are there just a bunch of 6'6+ guys who were practicing their whole lives to play professional basketball who didn't end up making it pro somewhere in the world for at least one game? like if you're 6'6+ you would immediately be among the tallest players in the taiwanese league

For example if we took all the 6'6+ D1 Players in NCAA, how many of them make it pro somewhere in the world?

Well looking at the research: https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2015/3/6/estimated-probability-of-competing-in-professional-athletics.aspx

53% of D1 men's basketball players ended up playing pro the year after they left college. When just looking at college basketball overall, it drops to 21% played pro the next year. I think the percentages would likely be higher if we're only looking at 6'6 and higher.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15m4j02
499,What is the best playoff series from teams where neither made the finals?,nba,"The question can also somewhat be rephrased as “what is the best first round or semifinals playoff series”. I initially thought to ask the question of the best playoff series from teams where neither won the championship, but this would include conference finals matchups which are generally more exciting and in some cases considered “the real NBA finals”.

Off the top of my head from recent memory + being a Laker fan, both the Grizzlies and Warriors series this past year were very exciting to watch with many storylines. I’m sure there’s ONE definite answer I can’t think of right now but what do ya’ll think.


EDIT: Idk about series and idk if my details are right, but my core Jokic memory and when I realized he was legit was that one Portland game that went to a couple OTs (i think) in 2019 and Jokic was absolutely GASSED from carrying the nuggets",t5_2qo4s,t3_15m47c0

502,Was Michael Jordan really 6'6 ?,nba,"Hi Everyone I recently discovered that Michael Jordan despite being listed at 6'6 is actually 6'4 3/4

I was watching old MJ highlights and this one video against Boston Celtics MJ walked by the late Reggie Lewis , and Reggie seemed taller then Mj....Reggie is listed as 6'5.

Then I searched google  and it states that Pat Riley once said

""Did you know that when Jordan was measured he was only 6-4 and a half, not 6-6 the way he's listed"". Jordan was officially measured at 6′4 3/4 by the US Olympics team. And he looks about the same height as Charles Barkley, who he admitted himself, in his book, to standing 6′4 3/4″.

Then I asked google to show me some images of MJ and Charles Barkley side by side and yea they are both the same height with the eye test ?

Is this one of basketballs craziest conspiracies or what ?

I tried linking pictures with MJ and Charles but Reddit would not allow it for some reason.

Thanks.

523,Do you think there has been over/under 2.5 billion pictures of Lebron James taken?,nba,"Things to think about:

Every single picture of him taken since December 30, 1984. 

Everytime someone takes a picture of him in the area that counts as one. 

If they take 10 in that span of a second, that counts as 10. 

Video recordings do not count. Screenshots of screen recordings do not count. 

If Lebron is in the picture and you can easily tell it’s him (like if it’s a picture of D. Wade, but Lebron is in the back warming up), that counts. 

If 2.5 billion is low, what’s a better over or under?


For me:

Just my thoughts. 

With 82 games a year (without playoffs), and let’s say 20,000 fans per game, let’s say everyone and their toddler takes 10 pics of Lebron.

82 x 20,000 = 1,640,000

1,640,000 x 10 = 16,400,000

16,400,000 x 20 (years)= 328,000,000.

James Harden is an analogy I like to use, not because they’re all that similar in either talent or playstyle, but the parts of their game that are glorified and criticized are polar opposite. 

With Harden it’s “he’s a chucker”, with Kobe it’s “killer instinct”. With Harden his foul baiting is “terrible for the sport” but with Kobe the rip through was “a high IQ play”. I’m not saying either side is right or wrong, but it pisses me off that it’s so inconsistent.

563,Luke Kennard Quietly Had One of the Best Shooting Seasons Ever. Can He Break the Record?,nba,"Last season Luke Kennard shot 49% from three, which grades as the ninth best three-point shooting performance of all time (shooting more threes per game than anyone above him too). However, what's even more intriguing is his production as a Grizzly. Once joining the Grizzlies, Kennard shot 5.7 threes a game and made 54% of them. This would have been statistically the best shooting performance of all time. While it was only 24 games, Coach Jenkins heavily stressed that he wants him shooting more than he ever has in his career and made it a point to draw up plays for him. 

After leading the NBA in 3pt% the past two seasons, what are the chances he can break the record officially? The current holder is Kyle Korver with 53.6% on 2.1 attempts per game. He's already proven he can sustain 54% on nearly 6 attempts a game, now he's just gotta do it for a full season. Breaking this record would solidify Kennard as one of the greatest shooters ever, and really get him some recognition as I believe he's been overlooked for the majority of his career. 

**Why he can do it:** With the green light from coach, the spacing with another elite shooter in Bane (2nd best 3pt% in 2021-22), and the facilitating from Ja, I think it's in the realm of possibility. When Ja is on the court, he can draw double teams and pull defenders closer to the basket, opening up opportunities for Luke. I also think Steven Adams being the best offensive rebounder in the league helps a lot with second chance open threes. 

**Why he can't:** Kyle Korver had the benefit of only shooting two threes a game and only played in 54 games the season he set the record. Luke shooting six a game and playing 82 games is already a massive disadvantage due to the sustainability and volume that could have an effect on his shooting. Steph Curry is widely considered the greatest shooter of all time and he's never even shot 46% due to volume. Luke's best chance at breaking a record like this is taking less shots which would be detrimental to his team.

At the end of the day, we haven't seen shooting this accurate since 2009, and this is on a much higher volume. Shooting 54% from three for a team in a season to my knowledge has never been done, so what he did as a Grizzly last year is already incredibly special. From all the stats I can find, nobody has shot as accurate as Kennard on 4.6+ three attempts a game **ever**. We are witnessing an all-time shooting performance and it's going pretty under the radar.

B) current/past rosters

If he doesn't land a job, it'll end one of the most impactful, underrated, infuriating, and misunderstood careers of his generation.",nba,"Now 34 years old, Blake Griffin is having trouble landing a job in free agency. If he does sign somewhere, it'll likely be in a reserve role. Last season for the Celtics, he played a total of 569 minutes in the regular season and only 6 minutes in the playoffs.

If Griffin's career ends with a whimper or a blurb buried at the bottom of ESPN, it'll be understating the impact of a player who had a major (albeit brief) influence on the league.

---


######**PART ONE: Instant Impact On the Court**

Playing for his local University of Oklahoma, Blake Griffin had a strong freshman year. He averaged 14.7 points (on 56.8% from the field) and 9.1 rebounds. The consensus from NBA scouts was that Griffin was a likely top lottery pick, and could have presumably climbed into the top 5-6 with strong workouts. 

However, Griffin must have felt there was still some work to do and still some upside on the table. He wasn't getting quite the national attention or draft respect he thought he may deserve, so he made the unconventional decision to return to college for his sophomore year. And there, Griffin removed all doubts that he had star potential. He put up monster numbers (22.7 points, 14.4 rebounds) and led the Sooners to a 30-6 record and an Elite Eight appearance. He was named the National Player of the Year and became the obvious # 1 pick in the draft.

Griffin got injured and missed his first year for the L.A. Clippers, setting up a highly-anticipated ""rookie"" season the following year. Griffin delivered -- and then some. That first year, Griffin averaged 22.5 points, 12.1 rebounds (a career high), and 3.8 assists. He was not only named as the easy ""Rookie of the Year,"" but he actually made the All-Star team and got on an MVP ballot -- finishing 10th overall.

Based on stats and accolades alone, you can argue that Blake Griffin had the best rookie season of the 2000s and perhaps the best since Tim Duncan.

---

######**PART TWO: Instant Impact Off the Court**

More impressive still, Blake Griffin did all that for the *Clippers*. It may be hard for younger NBA fans to understand how rotten the franchise had been at the time. The name ""Clippers"" was synonymous with ""sucks ass."" Since re-branding as the Clippers in 1978, the franchise made the playoffs 4 times. In 32 years. They were run by the deplorable and racist owner Donald Sterling, whose stink rotted the entire organization. At the time, the Clippers were the worst brand in the NBA.

That really did change with the arrival and optimism of Blake Griffin's prowess. Griffin became a star, and the fortunes turned for the franchise. The next year, the team traded for Chris Paul. Presumably, Paul wouldn't have agreed to join the team without a promising talent like Griffin on the roster. Two years later, the team hired Doc Rivers, whose stock was at an all-time high after his successful run with the Boston Celtics. Again, the idea that the *Clippers* could lure in a star coach would have been unthinkable a few years prior.

Thanks to Griffin (and Chris Paul, whose statistical impact can't be over-stated either), the Clippers went on an unprecedented run of success for the franchise. They won 50+ games five years in a row. And while that didn't result in an NBA Finals appearance, it did change the perception about the franchise. That only cemented a few years later, when Sterling was forced out and Steve Ballmer jumped in to provide stability (and deep pockets) to the team.

Right now, you'd put the Clippers into the ""glamor market"" tier -- a place where superstars may actually want to play. There are a variety of reasons why, but Blake Griffin's initial success did set the table for a lot of it. For that reason, his career goes behind numbers and W-L records and ranks as one of the most impactful in the broader NBA landscape.

---

######**PART THREE: An Underrated Skill Set**

When I suggest that Blake Griffin's career may be misunderstood or underrated, it's in regard to his actual basketball skill. There's a perception that Griffin came into the league as an ""athlete."" A dunker. In fact, his most defining basketball moment may have been his [Dunk Contest](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/blake-griffin-soars-over-car-to-win-slam-dunk-contest) win. And then, when he started to suffer injuries, he started to evolve his game to fit his declining athleticism.

That's not wholly true. The truth is, Griffin was *always* an underrated playmaker. He had great handles for his size and position and a good passing instinct. That's illustrated by his 3.8 assists as a rookie -- but also during the times when he was allowed to fully showcase his skill set.

When Chris Paul came to the team (in Griffin's second year) and took over the primary ballhandling duties, Griffin didn't always get the opportunity to show his full ""bag."" When he did take that alpha dog role, he shined. In 2013-14, CP3 missed 20 games due to injury, and Griffin responded with a career year and finished 3rd in MVP voting. 

We also saw that play out in 2018-19 after Griffin had lost a step and ended up in Detroit. It's largely a forgotten period in his career, but Griffin did have a brief standout stretch for the Pistons. That season, he averaged 24.5 points and 5.4 assists and helped a mediocre Detroit team make the playoffs.

These numbers -- a big averaging 4/5/6 assists -- don't really jump off the page in the modern NBA where we can see Nikola Jokic putting up 30/10/10 every night -- but they represent one of the better playmaking numbers for the PF position during that era.

---

######**PART FOUR: A Whole Bunch of Hypotheticals**

While Blake Griffin had a great NBA career and a good amount of team success with the Clippers, you can't help but wonder if they could have done more as a group together. ""What if?""

Maybe the team simply wasn't good enough. Maybe they'd never have won a title. But you can squint and see potential room for improvement from the club.

A lot of that is injury related, but I would say some of it was due to human error as well. The Clippers had a well-rounded starting four -- PG Chris Paul, SG J.J. Redick, PF Blake Griffin, and C DeAndre Jordan -- with an obvious hole in the middle at SF. It's a riddle that they were never quite able to solve as Matt Barnes started to age and decline.

The Clippers had some chances to fill it, but didn't take advantage. They cut Joe Ingles in training camp -- a heady well-rounded player that would have fit perfectly. They marginalized and traded a young Reggie Bullock -- another player who could have fit well as a 3+D wing.

Instead of taking a chance and developing young talent, Doc Rivers (as he's inclined to do) tapped the well of overrated and over-aged players instead. In Rivers' first year on the job as the coach and primary GM, he brought in a slew of over-the-hill veterans: Danny Granger (who was cooked by then), Big Baby Davis (same), Hedo Turkoglu (age 34), Stephen Jackson (age 35), and Antawn Jamison (age 37). All five of those players were out of the league by the end of the following year.

Rather than learn his lesson, Rivers kept striking out instead. He made the wrong choice repeatedly, falling back on old loyalties and biases rather than what was plainly in front of him. He over-played (and overpaid) his own son Austin Rivers as a result of that. But perhaps the epitome of Rivers' front office failures was the Clippers decision to bring in Paul Pierce (then age 38) at the tail end of his career. Sadly, it wasn't with the intention of using Pierce as a veteran mentor: it was with the intention of playing him minutes. At that age, Pierce wasn't up to the task. He shot 36.3% from the field and looked unplayable. Rather than realize that, Rivers started Pierce for 38 games. Somehow, the Clippers still won 51 games that year.

You do wonder what the Clippers could have been if they had a more competent coach in charge (or at least, had taken away Doc Rivers' personnel power earlier). 

---

######**PART FIVE: Cruel Fate and Cruel Fists** 

It'd be incomplete to write about Blake Griffin's career and not mention the long list of injuries that's plagued him throughout. We can't blame that on Doc Rivers. 

(Well, maybe we can, if you factor in that the Clippers overplayed Griffin early in his career. Like Zion Williamson, he's a power player who plays with a lot of intensity, and requires a lighter touch than other stars).

Still, Griffin got hurt a lot and that may have been bound to happen regardless. We can also blame him specifically for the injury when he fractured his hand after punching a trainer.

There's also some ""inevitability"" to Griffin's limited career when you consider his body type. He's a thick guy, but he has a limited wingspan (at 6'11""). When you're not very long, you're going to be limited as a shot blocker regardless of your athleticism. We saw that play out in his NBA career -- where he's only averaged 0.5 blocks per game -- and we're seeing that play out with Zion Williamson in New Orleans now. 

If Griffin was a little taller or longer, teams would have been able to play him more often as a smallball ""big"" (which they probably should have done anyway). The one area where Griffin did adjust his game to fit his declining athleticism was by shooting more threes -- and he did that reasonably well -- but he couldn't overcome his lack of length in the same way. (He also got better at comedy!, going from a little overexposed early to solid comedic performer at the Comedy Central roasts).

---

######**TL; DR**

Overall, it'll be interesting to see how history remembers the career of Blake Griffin (if this is indeed the end for him). As mentioned, he had an oversized impact for his franchise early on, then eventually got derailed by injuries.

In terms of basketball, is he going to be a Hall of Famer? That's TBD. He's a six-time All-Star, but never made the Finals and never won MVP. Basketball-reference lists his Hall of Fame probability at 54.8%, which may be optimistic.

Still, I'd maintain that Blake Griffin had one of the most impactful, underrated, misunderstood, and infuriating careers in our era for a variety of reasons.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15lm16f

The Lakers stand tall with his leadership grand,

594,"If Elon Musk Owned An NBA Team, How Many Teams Would Have A Worse Owner Than Him?",nba,"At this point, it's fair to say the Tesla owner, Zuckerberg-dodging dork has fully shattered his image as tech nerd's favorite billionaire, with said image replaced with one of incompetence, laughability and in general showcasing poor management and even worse ideas.

He is very bad at the whole ""running a company"" thing, exemplified by his tumultuous tenure of meddling, firings and so on with Twitter, to say nothing about the horrendous rebranding of it into X, among other failed business ventures that led to him being outed as CEO from several companies such as PayPal and Zip2.

This got me thinking about the NBA owners and who some of the worst are/have been for years and how they compare to Musk were he to, say, own one of the eagerly anticipated expansion teams.

Some of the worst (current) owners include, in no particular order...

**Jody Allen, Blazers** \- From one of the more passionate owners in her brother Paul to one of the least.  A bone-smuggling, alleged sexual harasser, Jody oversaw the Blazers front office become a cesspool of  toxicity and players of increasing unhappiness.  I'm not just referring to Dame and the slow breakup of him and the Blazers, Gary Trent Jr. was reportedly ""depressed"" and ""played with so much pain"" for Portland's team according to his father.

The formation of a [toxic workplace/culture](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/03/1061295224/portland-trail-blazers-general-manager-neil-olshey-fired) is something you're going to see pop up a lot with these teams, by the way.

**Marc Cuban, Mavericks** \- Cuban is lucky the Mavericks won in 2011 because it made everyone forget that he broke up the dynamic duo of Dirk and future 2x MVP Steve Nash despite the two of them going deep into the playoffs.  Beyond wondering how the 2006 Finals would have looked were Cuban willing to pay Nash what he was worth, there's also the immediate breaking up of the 2011 Mavericks core in an attempt to free up cap space for a big name free agent and season after season of star chasing that never ended up yielding Dirk a co-star in his twilight years.

It is also worth mentioning that in 2018, [an investigation into Dallas' workplace](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/02/21/dallas-mavericks-sexual-misconduct-investigation-mark-cuban-response)was published.  It cited a predatory, misogynistic environment fostered by an immature manchild of an owner that was described as an ""animal house"", including allegations of domestic abuse unrelated to the well known abuse involving their current head coach, Jason Kidd.

**The DeVos family, Magic** \- Orlando has actually been run rather well of late - their fleecing of the Bulls is a testament to that - and their young core is amongst the more promising in the league.  That is largely in spite of the DeVos family's ownership who you might have recently learned about them owning the team - which has a predominantly black roster - after donating $50,000 to Ron DeRacist's campaign.

Beyond that, it shouldn't be forgotten how bad their post-Dwight, pre-Paolo rebuild ended up being, peaking at a first round exit as the 7th seed, albeit to the eventual champions in 2019, after putting their fans through hell for about 5 years.

**James Dolan, Knicks** \- Like the Magic, the Knicks have been run relatively well as of late.  That's good for them but it stands in contrast to the meddling and incompetence that Dolan was constantly responsible for post-Ewing.  Bad trades, massive overpays for washed players, botched draft picks, you name it, he's been a part of it.  Needless to say that if Dolan were still meddling, the Knicks would have thrown every pick and player asked of them for Donovan Mitchell.  Prolly even some young guys they were never asked to.

Even with the more hands-off approach, James managed to embroil the Knicks in controversy last season with his [employment of facial recognition software](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/02/james-dolan-madison-square-garden-move-saga-face-recognition) to intimidate people who are critical of his thin-skinned self on social media or the like.  He also kicked out Charles Oakley, a player who was with the team for over a decade, in the middle of a game and temporarily banned them from attending Knicks games.  And no, this isn't even the weirdest story involving Dolan and a Knicks player; just ask Carmelo Anthony about Dolan's staff spying on him.

Dolan hasn't been as bad *of* *late* but historically, few owners have the lengthy resume of futility and atrocious decision-making that Dolan does.  He deserves special consideration due to also owning the WNBA team New York Liberty (aka. a women's basketball team) at the time when hiring Isiah Thomas to run the team despite Thomas engaging in sexual harassment during his time with the Knicks in the 00s.  This was a particularly infamous case that ended up with a jury ruling in favor of Anucha Browne Sanders, a former woman executive of the Knicks who was fired after complaining about said sexual harassment, rewarding her nearly $12 million dollar in damages.

I eagerly await being banned from the garden for posting this.  Sell the team, Dolan.

**Vivek Ranadivé, Kings** \- I feel like the recent season of competence we've seen from the Kings in the 2022/23 season has made a lot of people forget how horrible the Kings have been.  Not all of the nearly two decades of basement-dwelling was Ranadivé's fault but since owning the team in 2013, it most certainly was.  Poor hiring decisions for the front office, awful trades and a failure to build around one of the few players that wasn't a draft bust during said tenure in DeMarcus Cousins, it should go without saying that being a fan of the Beam Team was excruciating, and while the Haliburton trade is now seen as a win-win, it cannot be understated how bad the move looked at the time when the Kings were 12th in the standings at the time and 12th come the season's end.

Once again, there's [allegations of a toxic work environment](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10032227-former-kings-employee-says-sacramento-has-toxic-workplace-and-is-basketball-hell) and mistreatment of staff, allegations that remain rather recent - a former employee made said allegations in 2022 - and should not be overlooked despite the otherwise optimistic and refreshing season Sacramento had last year.

*Honorable Mention*: **Michael Jordan, Hornets** \- The GOAT is no longer up for the crown amongst atrocious ownership but let it not be said that he didn't leave his mark on the franchise.  Quite literally up to the last minute as he had the final say on choosing Brandon Miller over Scoot Henderson, a decision which may seem to early to judge as a mistake were it not for MJ's historically awful drafting pedigree that dates back to his days with the Wizards.  Also a ton of overpay contracts for which Charlotte is still literally paying for to this day as Gordon Hayward enters the final year of his $120 million contract ($31.5M for this year).

So of these many owners, which ones were/are as bad as Elon Musk would be in this hypothetical?  I think James Dolan's record firmly places him as the worst current owner even with him not meddling in team affairs like he used to.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15l8yyo

596,New Event idea (Fiba vs Nba),nba,"So Instead of the In season tournament, the NBA should collab with Fiba for a tournament.

Here's how it works. Around February, The top Seeds in the EC and WC should have a 5 game tournament (Like the finals). Then have the same tournament for 2 Fiba teams. Then they have a 7 game tournament. Whatever team wins gets a 20 Million Dollar bonus plus the Nba midseason cup. 

Example: The Bucks and Mavericks are the top teams in the EC and WC. The Bucks win in 4 and go on to the finals. Spain and China are chosen (I don't know how Fiba works that much). Spain Wins and goes to the finals. The Bucks face off against China, each wearing custom jerseys. The Bucks take the first round but China takes the second. China wins the third but the Bucks take the 4th. China Takes round 5 and the Bucks win round 6 and 7, giving them the championship. The bucks then get a 20-mill bonus plus a midseason tournament cup.

597,What are the chances of Austin Reaves being an all-star in the next 5 years?,nba,"Based on how he performed for Team USA, how do you feel about Austin Reaves's chances of making the All-Star team within the next 5 years?

First off, he's a good playmaker and a very efficient scorer from the perimeter, as well as a great foul-baiter. He is the scoring guard LeBron needs and will cook when the game calls for it.

Second, he's a starting guard for the Los Angeles Lakers which will help him get the votes he needs esp when someone is injured. The fact that Steve Kerr got him in Team USA means he's gonna be loved by the coaches as well if he plays up to standards.

There are a lot of interesting shorter guys who would have been even greater with some more height and I even think a guy like Yao would have benefitted from being a little shorter.

1. The New Orleans Pelicans need to become the **New Orleans Jazz** again.
2. The Atlanta Hawks need to become **the Atlanta Kings**, in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It might be a little bit awkward naming a basketball team after a legendary black civil rights hero, but MLK really does deserve to have his name more preserved in the city of Atlanta specifically as it was the city where he was born, raised, educated and made famous.
3. The Brooklyn Nets need to become the **Brooklyn Rap**. We already have the Jazz in the NBA and the St. Louis Blues in the NHL.  It would be cool if Rap had a team. The team is also owned by Jay Z and NYC is the birthplace of hip hop. Many famous rappers came out of Brooklyn specifically.
4. The Sacramento Kings and the Utah Jazz can either take the Hawks or Nets name or think of something new entirely.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15l5y58

Conversely, football fans and management are often calling for their teams to try and form what would essentially be equivalent to a super team by grouping the most talented stars together. For example Real Madrid had a policy of purchasing the best players in the world to be part of what they referred to as the  ""Galacticos"". This policy lasted for nearly a decade and the only people who hated it were rival fans.

It was heavily skewed towards Jordan's view of events and in return he allowed them to have exclusive footage and interviews with him. I get it, we can move on.

Beyond all of that we know that Jordan was a tough guy on himself and his teammates. Sometimes he went too far and a theme of the doc is largely that it's what pushed the team to greatness. In comes Rodman though who does his own thing and is his own guy. It seems like the exact opposite of the kind of personality that could work with Jordan at all, but the doc never touches on them butting heads.

2022: Kyrie Irving and Karl Anthony Towns: 60 

2021: Stephen Curry: 62

2020: Damian Lillard x2: 61 

2019: James Harden x2: 61

648,Anthony Davis Joins $60M Club,nba,"Lakers star, Anthony Davis, officially enters the $60M club.

Last week, the big man lands the richest annual extension in NBA history as he has agreed on a three-year $186M max extension.

There is no denying how dominant Anthony Davis is on the court, however, the inconsistency is what’s frustrating. The elite big man has only played in 194 of 318 games as a Laker (61%).

Breaking it down even further, Anthony Davis has played an average of 60 games per season since being drafted in 2012. If he keeps that up, he will be making over $1M per game on his new $186M extension.

Let’s take a look at his projected salary for the next 5 years:

2023-24: $40.6M  
2024-25: $43.2M  
2025-26: $57.6M  
2026-27: $62.2M  
2027-28: $66.8M

Not only will he have earned about $500M on the court alone by age 34, but he will join Damian Lillard in the $60M club when 2027 rolls around.

650,[Discussion] Lebron's amazing 9 game stretch in the NBA finals,nba,"In the finals from LeBron in game 5 2016 finals to game 1 2018 finals he averaged: 

- 36.4 points/game
- 11.4 rebounds/game

-  Whopping 3.6 Stks (1.9 SPG/1.7 BPG)
-  55/40/72 splits
-  Overcame a 3-1 deficit (in 2016)

Here's some more numbers for nerds:

- 62.5 ts% (+9.8 rTS) based off league ts% vs warriors 16-18
- Had 4 of the top 15 highest gamescores in NBA finals history.
- Had 3 games over a BPM of 20 (game 5-6 2016 &amp; game 1 in 2018 finals)
- Against -6.9 relative to league avg defensive rating (based on Warriors performance in WC playoffs relative to playoff average) (gassing it up)

In comparison here's Mj's best 9 game finals stretch (92/93) offensively: 39.7 ppg 7.2 rpg 5.8 apg on 58% TS, amazing as well!

653,"Do people actually believe in the ""Nuggets got it easy by not playing the Bucks or Celtics in the final"" idea?",nba,"When some people discuss the most recent championship the asterisk for Denver is ""All they did was play low seeds so it was easy for them"". I'm a Nuggets fan so there's obviously bias on my end but from a logic POV how does this make any sense? So the 8th seed Heat (who dealt with injuries) defeated both the 1st and 2nd seed Bucks and Celtics in the playoff rounds leading to the final, which the Nuggets would then beat Miami for the championship. But if the Nuggets played teams who were proven to be worse - the Bucks or Celtics, it would have been more difficult for them and a more competitive finals series? 

Again how does this logic make any sense? Why didn't Milwaukee or Boston just beat Miami if they were worthy finals teams? And it's not like the Bucks had the ""Giannis was also injured"" excuse, they dropped 140 points on the Heat without him and should have 100% won the series regardless. And as for the 7th seed Lakers, they changed their squad and instantly improved their team half way through the season to be a top 4 team in the west. So if they played the 2nd seed Grizzlies, who lost to the Lakers in the first round, or the Kings who lost to a team the Lakers would also beat in the 2nd round, those teams would have gave Denver more trouble?

665,[CNBC] TNT NBA Games to be simulcast on a new tier of MAX this season.,nba,"&gt; Warner Bros. Discovery has targeted the beginning of the Major League Baseball playoffs to debut a sports tier for its Max streaming service, according to people familiar with the matter.
&gt; 
&gt; The company plans to charge users more if they want to watch sports on Max.
&gt; The new streaming tier will be branded under the Bleacher Report name and will include highlights and interviews in addition to games.


&gt; The NBA, which begins its regular season Oct. 24, has discussed a similar arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, where only games that air on the TNT cable network would be simulcast on Max, said the people familiar with the matter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Any exclusive Max games would begin next year at the earliest and would likely be a part of the NBA’s rights renewal agreement** with Warner Bros. Discovery, the people said.

src: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/warner-bros-discovery-targets-max-streaming-sports-tier-for-october.html


This is good news for inside the nba. Warner heads have been reported to be so-so on bidding high for nba rights on the new contract and the NBA plans to require streaming options.  Having a live game streaming service already in action would be an important part of their bid. 

MAX with ads is currently 9.99 with ads, 15.99 without. How the new plan will be priced and packaged is unknown.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15kurmo

Many kinds of zebras make a braying sound, or a whinny. Each zebra's bray may have a different tone; some are high-pitched, others are low, and some are soft and others are very loud.This way there can be no fake whistles in the arena since every zebras sound will be known.

Anyways, I said something and people disagreed.  Enough for me to go down a YouTube rabbit hole a bit.

I’m now watching a video on why you should never talk shit to Tim Duncan, and listening to the way Garnett and Cousins will talk about him is jaw-dropping to someone who criminally underrated him throughout his entire career and retirement.

While KG’s shooting was wildly overrated, Dirk actually made it into a threat. While Dirk was nowhere near KG in defense, his offensive game created something truly unique. The mavs were never bad once he reached his prime. On the other hand, KG was truly outstanding on both sides.

Edit: 

1. massive ratio for me and yet every comment is “this sub massively overrated Dirk” or “this sub massively underrates KG”. Your favorite player isn’t underrated just because not every person shares your opinion. 

2. Personally I have KG over Dirk in talent and skill, but I’d rather have Dirk on my team since he improved the players around him more. So KG has more talent and is a better player, but Dirk will take me further imo.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15krv9t

---

######**category 1: the leftovers**

**Wes Unseld Jr., Washington Wizards**

It's a difficult situation when a new general manager takes over and inherits a head coach. Almost always, that GM is going to want to hire ""his own guy"" at some point. Of course, they have to wait until a proper justification to fire the existing coach.

At this point, it's hard to blame Wes Unseld Jr. for the middling results of his Washington team. He's been given a below-average roster, and he's delivered below-average results (35-47 and 35-47 in back to back years). What complicates the math from here is that Unseld shouldn't be expected to do any better this year after the team traded away Bradley Beal. And they may not *want* to do much better if the goal is to rebuild and get a top pick in the draft.

So what can Unseld Jr. do to keep his job? I don't think it'll be about wins and losses. There's not going to be a big difference between 25 wins, 30 wins, 35 wins, it's all about the same in the long run. I'd say that Unseld needs to prove his worth and show that he has some tangible value to a team, and that would likely come on the defensive end. He came to the Wizards with a reputation as a defensive specialist, but his defenses have ranked # 25 and # 21 respectively in his first two years. But if Unseld can coach this group up to a **top 20 defense**, then that would give him a solid chance of survival. You don't need ""A+"" talent to play hard on the defensive end, so that's a reasonable goal for this team. 

---

**Steve Clifford, Charlotte Hornets**

A coach is always in danger when there's a new GM in town, and that's doubly true when there's a new owner in town. The Hornets might be in line for a makeover, and that may not include the 61-year-old Steve Clifford. Heck, he wasn't even the old administration's first choice for the job to begin with (that would have been Kenny Atkinson, who slipped away at the last second).

Fortunately for Steve Clifford, he has some faint pathway to survival here. Despite the 27-55 record last year, the team isn't *that* bad. Last season was a nightmare, but they'll have LaMelo Ball back to full strength (after playing just 36 games). They'll have Miles Bridges back (and pretend to forget why he was gone). Sophomore Mark Williams may take a big step up and be an anchor down low. I don't think the play-in alone would be enough to keep Clifford safe, but if the team can **finish around .500**, that'd make it hard to fire Clifford. It'd mean an improvement of 15 games and put Clifford on the fringes of Coach of the Year talk. 

---

**Chauncey Billups, Portland Trail Blazers**

Damian Lillard distanced himself from the Chauncey Billups hiring as soon as the team got flak for it, but he was no doubt a large reason why the franchise brought in the respected floor general in the first place. Billups was also supposed to help on the defensive end. So far, it hasn't gone according to plan.

If Lillard exits now, where does that leave Chauncey Billups? Where does that leave GM Joe Cronin? The whole situation  feels like a trainwreck that would require a cleanup crew afterwards -- and makes their departure feel somewhat inevitable. 

At the same time, there is some glimmer of hope here. If Damian Lillard leaves (for a minimal return), that'd leave a wide open lane for rookie Scoot Henderson to come barreling through. It's not outrageous to think that he can compete for 20 PPG and a Rookie of the Year trophy. And if **Scoot Henderson wins Rookie of the Year**, a lot of those bad vibes would go away. Alternatively, if Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe look lost, then you'd expect the team to shed Billups and find a more proven coach going forward.

---

######**category 2: stuck in the middle with you**

**Jacque Vaughn, Brooklyn Nets**

It's easy to say that the Brooklyn Nets don't have any expectations at this point after losing Kevin Durant. And Kyrie Irving. And James Harden. This is a rebuilding situation, right?

Well... not entirely. This isn't as young of a team as you may expect. Later this month, Mikal Bridges will turn 27, matching the age of Cam Johnson and Ben Simmons. Those aren't young prospects -- those are players expected to be in their primes. Meanwhile, 3+D wings Dorian Finney-Smith and Royce O'Neale are already 30. This is a team that's good enough and old enough to compete for the playoffs.

I don't necessarily know if the Nets need to **make the playoffs** for Jacque Vaughn to keep his job, but it sure wouldn't hurt. If not, the team will likely make some big moves in the offseason -- either cashing in their chips for a star or going into a full rebuild instead. In either case, they may remake the coaching staff as well.

---

**Billy Donovan, Chicago Bulls**

Billy Donovan may be in a similar situation in Chicago. In fact, his roster is even older. If the Bulls **make the playoffs**, you can justify their decision to keep on chugging. If they fall short of that, it feels inevitable that the team will finally embrace a tear-down and rebuild.

If that happens, it may be a mutual decision to part ways. Donovan's background is in the NCAA so in theory he'd be well-suited to develop a young roster. At the same time, he's 58 years old and he'd have already coached for 9 years in the NBA. Does he have the patience for a reset? Would the team want young blood instead? All in all, it feels like this may be a make or break season for Donovan and the Bulls' sense of stagnation.

---


######**category 3: put up or shut up**

**Jason Kidd, Dallas Mavericks**

Owner Mark Cuban has a man-crush on Jason Kidd (who helped the team win a title as a player), but there's a limit to how far that affection can take you. If the Mavs don't improve drastically from their 38-44 record, then you'd have to expect a housecleaning here. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the Mavs need to **win a playoff series** for Kidd to feel totally safe in this situation.

Winning a series (or at least, making it competitive) isn't unrealistic for this team. There are some question marks about the center position and about the depth, but they have elite top-end talent in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Doncic is arguably a top 5 player in the league. And for all the criticism Irving gets, he's been lights out offensively over the last few years. If Grant Williams can come in and maintain his shooting from the corners (42.7% for his career), this offense should be one of the league's best. If they don't... Luka Doncic may be unhappy... which means Mark Cuban may be unhappy... which means Kidd may be in trouble.

---

**Willie Green, New Orleans Pelicans**

Although the New Orleans Pelicans didn't make the playoffs either, there are going to be high expectations for this club. They finished 42-40 despite only getting 29 games from Zion Williamson. No one's counting on Williamson to play a full 82, but he should at least play *more* than that. In theory.

If he does, this team is chocked full of talent -- both in terms of high-end stars but also in terms of depth. I suspect Willie Green will need to make the most of that and at least **make the playoffs** (health permitting). If they fall short again, it may be time for a more experienced hand. The market isn't great, but the roster's good enough to draw in some top coaching candidates.

---

**Joe Mazzulla, Boston Celtics**

In his first year on the job, Joe Mazzulla finished 57-25 and made the Eastern Conference Finals. For 95% of franchises, that'd be a home run. Instead, it got him all sorts of criticism for underachieving.

This year, Mazzulla should be bolstered by an even stronger roster and a stronger support staff, which will now include Charles Lee and Sam Cassell. In some ways, that's a double-edged sword. Perhaps more than any other coach, Mazzulla needs to ""win now"" -- as in, in the Fall and Winter of 2023. If the team stumbles out of the gates (let's say they have an 8-10 record), he may well be fired and replaced by Lee or Cassell.

Presuming the Celtics roll into the playoffs, the bar should still be high. In fact, I'd suspect Mazzulla will only feel comfortable if the team **makes the Finals**. Anything less will seem like a disappointment. Fortunately for Maz, all the talent's here to make that run.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15kniiy

708,Is the idea of Scoot Henderson actually being a good G League player… true?,nba,"I posted this on r/nba_draft, and I would like to preface this by saying Scoot is a very talented player and was the 2nd best player in the draft.  Regardless of his efficiency, he is still a player who has potential to run an offense one day and be dynamic at the PG spot.


3 point shooting track record: 

Scoot is at: 
G League Reg Season career: 14/51 (27.5%) from 3


G League Showcase Career: 12/40 (30%) from 3 


and his free throw % is in the mid to low 70’s, it’s nothing great tbh


Since Scoot is a poor 3 point shooter and is only 6'2, he shoots around 58% at the rim overall iirc. However, most people don't acknowledge that Scoot doesn't actually get to the rim that much. He takes an extremely high volume of mid range shots which tank his effciency because even though he is good at them, they aren't inherently efficient shots when you have a bad 3 ball and only average FG at the rim

The G League has a rule where you shoot 1 free throw for 2 points, which heavily inflates his TS. If you were to assume that 1.8/2 free throws are only 2 point foul shots (meaning the other stuff is left out including techs, and 1s, etc.), his regular season TS this year would be 50%, which is likely the worst by far out of any G League guard that averages 16.5 (he averaged 16.5 points on 14.1 FGA)

If you want the proper efficiency metrics for his whole G League career;

&gt; So scoot had 441 pts on 142 twos 22 threes &amp; 54 FTs made. 142×2+22×3+54×1 = 404
441-404 = 37
""Normal"" rules he would have made 54+37 = 91 FTs

75% FT last year but 76.2 in both GL seasons combined.
 91÷.762 =119

370 FGAs last year + 119 FTAs × 0.44 = 422
441÷2÷422=52.3 TS%

Source: https://twitter.com/mikegrib8/status/1681413057980030976


Personally, I've known that Scoot was inefficient but I don't think it matters too much because he is still a very talented player for his age. I do have some worries about his efficiency though given he needs to be a star, and I'm not sure an inefficient lead guard without an ELITE trait as a creator (Maybe his mid range game, but I don't think his rim pressure is as good as advertised) might keep him ffrom 1 on a championship team. I do think he is clearly the 2nd best player in the draft though, he's just super talented with a great feel for the game on offense. If I had more confidence in his defense, if he was an outlier in terms of getting to the rim or better at shooting, I feel like he would have a decent argument for being a better prospect 


[For reference, Scoot Henderson ranks 373rd/495in efficiency (TS%) among G League player players with 15 or more games played, go to page 6](https://stats.gleague.nba.com/players/advanced/?sort=TS_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=GP*GE*15&amp;Season=2022-23&amp;SeasonType=Combined)",t5_2qo4s,t3_15khw5a

* Add a single sixth man, coach and most improved player team like they have for allnba, all defensive and all rookie

* Make the scoring/rebounds/assists titles go off of total points and not averages (that way it rewards both high scoring and consistency

* Expand the Hall of Fame to also include guys who were great at one aspect of the game. Like how we induct great international players who weren't neccesarily the best NBA players, I'd similarily induct great defenders like Bruce Bowen or Mark Eaton

* Retroactively award things like finals MVP to players who were around before the award was introduced. It'd be a great way to honor some of the earlier players, especially when that era isn't as talked about/gets devalued in modern conversations.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15kfv7b

I am a huge Lebron fan and I think basically that Lebron is a better player than Jordan but Jordan had the best career and is therefore the GOAT.  


What I mean is that assuming you were to have each of them replay their careers under many different scenarios (eg drafted by different teams, having different team mates etc) I think, in general, Lebron probably would end up having a better career in most scenarios.  


However, that is not how the real world works and Jordan had his basically pristine career whereas Lebron definitely has more career blemishes, even if on paper, he might be the better player.

&gt;  
&gt;*""Williams led a wide-ranging scheme to steal millions of dollars from the NBA Players' Health and Welfare Benefit Plan. Williams recruited medical professionals and others to expand his criminal conspiracy and maximize his ill-gotten gains. Williams not only lined his pockets through fraud and deceit, but he also stole the identities of others and threatened a witness to further his criminal endeavors. For his brazen criminal acts, Williams now faces years in prison.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;According to [Larry Neumeister](https://apnews.com/article/nba-health-fraud-williams-96bd079c6a3632addecde71efaed74e7) of the Associated Press, Williams' healthcare scam lasted from 2017 to 2021 and saw him defraud $5 million from the NBA Health and Welfare Benefit Plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;Williams enlisted the help of a dentist in California and doctors in both California and Washington to file claims for ""fictitious medical and dental expenses.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge Valerie E. Caproni chastised Williams for his actions, saying: ""You were yet another player who frittered away substantial earnings from the period of time when you were playing basketball professionally. You should have had enough money to be set for life, but you don't.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Williams pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit healthcare and wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, making him the 13th former NBA player to plead guilty in a wide-ranging healthcare fraud case. Five other former NBA players have been charged as well.

“Jaren, particularly (Saturday), his energy and the way he went to the glass and went to the foul line every other possession,” said point guard Jalen Brunson, in articulating his support for Jackson. “He was just really a force (in the Saturday scrimmage against the U.S. Select Team).”

743,Who wins a 7 game series: all time Centers vs all time Power Forwards?,nba,"Centers:

Starting lineup: Kareem, Hakeem, Shaq, Wilt, Bill Russell

Bench: David Robinson, Jokic, Moses Malone

Power Forwards: 

Starting lineup: Tim Duncan, Giannis, Dirk, KG, Karl Malone

Bench: Barkley, Mchale, Anthony Davis

Who would win?

The centers have more overall historical success and dominance but in a pure basketball lineup they are heavily lacking in spacing aside from Jokic and David Robinson, and Hakeem a bit but would be ridiculously dominant in the paint. Defensively they have ridiculous rim protection and paint defense but not great ability to defend out in the perimeter aside from Hakeem and bill Russell. Overall they don’t have much elite playmaking but of course they do have Jokic who’s one of the best playmakers of all time. All of them are dominant rebounders. Aside from Jokic don’t really have anyone who’s comfortable dribbling the ball for an extended period of time. 

Power forwards have a lot more versatility on offense and defense. They have guys who space the floor with 3s and midrange shots in dirk, KG, Tim Duncan, AD, Karl malone. Basically all of them are dominant paint scorers, particularly Barkley, Mchale, malone, Giannis. On defense they have have a lot of dominant rim protectors in Tim Duncan, KG, Giannis, AD. A lot of defensive versatility out on the perimeter in Giannis, KG, AD. 3 guys who can handle the ball and playmake in KG, Giannis, and Barkley.

I genuinely believe Paolo has a higher ceiling than Ant, Ja, Zion, etc. 

He’s basically 7 feet tall in shoes (6’10.5 barefoot), 250lb and has the fluidity of a wing. He basically has the perfect body for an NBA player with his size strength and mobility. 

We saw last year that he’s a talented scorer and playmaker, but I think the most impressive thing is how good he is at drawing FTs, which to me is a huge indicator of success. You might have bad shooting nights but as long as you can get those 10 FTA a night you’ll still be effective. The only other young guy who racks up FTA like him is Ja, but Ja does it in a way that isn’t sustainable long term and is a severe injury risk.

- George Hill, make your free throw. Biggest shot of your life and you look like a deer in headlights

Right now, LeBron is far and away more popular than any other player in the league, and now in LeBron’s 21st season, it makes me wonder when we will see the next player to reach the same stature as him.

Do you think any player currently right now can achieve that, or is the next global superstar some kid still growing up?",t5_2qo4s,t3_15jxg2w
775,All-Time Starting Five (stylistic fit - modern rules),nba,"PG - Steph Curry: Modern rules limiting contact against shooters and making defense less effective make Steph the best option here. Off-ball motion, passing, and shooting are all aspects of his game that make everyone around him better.

SG - Michael Jordan: I think Jordan may be a little overconfident for a team like this, but I can't put Kobe over him in good conscience. As above, the modern game emphasizes freedom of motion and scoring. Jordan's Off-ball movement is underrated, and his constant rim pressure would work very well next to Steph Curry specifically, especially considering the next 2 spots.

SF - Kevin Durant: KD's game is built for playing alongside superstars in the modern game.(shocker, I know) His size doesn't limit his effectiveness in a less physical game, and his ability to shoot from anywhere on the court while not being limited agility-wise would make him a dangerous off-ball threat no matter where he was on the court. Defensively, I also think it's worth mentioning that Durant has shown a greater willingness to play high level defense when his offensive load is lighter. In Golden State, he became a better shot blocker and inside presence overall while Steph and Klay could handle the offensive load without him being actively involved.

PF - Larry Bird: Definitely an uncommon choice at the 4 spot. Bird and Durant have very similar games, however, Bird is a better rebounder and is more floor-bound; which wouldn't be as much of a problem at the 4 as it would at the 3. In the modern game, Bird's IQ, shooting ability, and passing are more valuable than they even were in the 80's, while his defensive shortcomings are less important. Bird is also capable of hitting shots from all over the floor, and having a more effective post game at the 4 spot could be easily integrated to shake the offense up.

C - Kevin Garnett: Another unconventional choice. In the early 2000's, KG had to deal with centers like Shaq and David Robinson, and  could not effectively play that role. In 2023, KG is as reasonable a center as any. KG has shooting ability, can single-handedly anchor a defense on the inside, and would not have to deal with extensive rule changes. (Which is why Bill Russell and Wilt did not make the cut here) While we didn't get much of a chance to see it, KG was also a talented playmaker who would work better alongside HoF talent than more offensively oriented centers like Olajuwon or Shaq.

To me, the Nets would probably get beaten in 5-6 games by Atlanta, but even IF they somehow beat

Sure, there were tall guys like Dirk who could shoot who came before him, but his shooting coupled with his overall skills and mobility is unique. Has this not inspired a generation of players? Even, a player like Giannis (who can't shoot) still has some models of KD's game in his ability to bring the ball up the floor. In the 2000s, coaches may have seen Giannis has a back to the basket player and use him in a similar way to Shaq (rather than giving Giannis the ball at the top of the key and get to the paint).

Also, it seems that no one really talks about how KD changed the landscape on how teams view propsects? Look at Brandon Ingram, Victor Wembanyama or even Emoni Bates. These guys from the time they are teenagers were pegged to be NBA superstars (though in the case of Bates, he's obviously a bust) just because play somewhat like KD (along with being skinny, tall, and being able to dribble and shoot).",t5_2qo4s,t3_15jt46q

821,My Hot/Lukewarm Takes,nba,"1. Load management is not an issue. Player availability is decided by team medical staff. The increase in injuries has been occurring since the 90s and is a result of prolonged wear-and tear from AAU and youth basketball. Stop calling players soft, they're genuinely unable to play.

2. LeBron is the best scorer of all time. At minimum tied for top 3 or so. But you can't prove someone's better.

3. Superteams work well. Stacking all stars is the best route to winning a chip.

4. Anyone that devalues old legends' stats because old NBA was ""plumbers"" is wrong. Old stars had no one to learn from. If modern stars grew up in that era they'd be worse, and if old stars had modern training they'd be better.

5. Stephen Curry clearly deserves 3 FMVP ('15, '18, '22)

6. KD joining the warriors was, coincidentally, the most impactful decision in basketball history. It destroyed both Lebron and Curry's legacies, and it destroyed what would have easily been the globe's biggest sporting rivalry at the time (cavs v gsw). Without that move, Lebron has minimum 6 rings, Curry has at least 4 MVPs and disproves everything people say he can't do. Basketball history would be flipped upside down. Not blaming KD, but its just true, by coincidence.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15jffid
822,Who peaked higher: Nikola Jokic or Kevin Durant?,nba,"**Durant**

Kevin Durant is hailed as arguably the greatest scorer in NBA history due to his ability to score from quite literally anywhere on the floor, at a *very* high rate, in any which way. He also has 4 scoring titles to help his case. He hasn't won one since 2014 primarily due to injuries and star-studded rosters (I mean this in a very positive manner) which do not require him to score a million points every night. It would probably be a detriment to the team if Durant just ISO'd every play.

Durant was always in the conversation for best player in the league but could never quite get the title due to LeBron being at his peak and prime literally throughout KD's **entire career**, however gained notoriety for it after his title wins, with the bulk of it coming in 2019 after he was going nuts with a struggling Curry and LeBron out of the playoffs. His best case was after the Bucks series when he put up monster performances after his teammates went down, and people seriously considered him the best as the Bucks would've gotten white-washed if they were healthy. This time range can be from 2018-2021.

**The Joker**

Jokic came onto the scene much later, as his case for best player in the league laughably came during these playoffs, even though he was the **back-to-back MVP**, and only lost because he and the team threw in the towel towards the end of the season with Perkins running an anti-Jokic campaign on the outside.

He was clearly the best player in the postseason (honourably mention to Curry and Butler), and completely DOMINATED every team he played in ways I haven't really seen Durant do. He is clearly at his peak (or close to it). The one thing that is not in his favour is reps. He needs to have a bit more longevity to solidify his greatness.

For a select few, it may be the difference between getting their second contract or the difference between being taken seriously as a star or written off as a disappointment for one another. 

You never like to see young guys fail so early into their tenure as an NBA player.  Here are but a few for whom the next season might be their most important in their career.

  
**Kira Lewis Jr.** 

**22/23 Stats - 4.6/1.3/1.9 on 45/44/86 splits**

A pending RFA on the Pelicans, New Orleans is allegedly trying to find them a new place.  One hopes that Kira is able to break out elsewhere because they were not able to carve out a spot in the rotation, losing minutes in their 3rd year to a rookie named after a vacuum and only playing an average of 9 minutes.  
**Malachi Flynn** 

**22/23 Stats - 4.6/1.4/1.3 on 36/35/76 splits**

Flynn's decent rookie season seems like an outlier after failing to find  a role on a Raptors team that desperately needed (and still does!) a backup point guard, to say nothing of shooting that Flynn should, in theory, provide.  With the loss of Fred VanVleet and a change to a head coach that presumably doesn't hate him, there are neither excuses nor lack of opportunity for Malachi.  If he doesn't make the most of it, it would be shocking to see him get a 2nd contract.  
**Killian Hayes**

**22/23 Stats - 10.2/2.9/6.2 on 38/28/82 splits**

It almost feels like cheating to include Hayes because the same  thing was said about him last year when the Pistons lost Cade Cunningham to injury.  The only difference is he's - you guessed it - in a contract year and is almost certainly not getting extended, let alone a serious offer in free agency next year unless he can show any improvement.

  
**James Wiseman**

**22/23 Stats - 10/5.9/0.7 on 56/20/70 splits**

No, not every name on this list is going to be an upcoming RFA from the 2020 draft class but James Wiseman is especially worth noting because he is battling for his minutes against the similarly athletic  bigs on Detroit's roster in Jalen Duren and Marvin Bagley, and while both of them have their flaws - Bagley in particular is another candidate to consider for this list - none of them make one cry via their advanced stats like James Wiseman does.  Given how much he's making as the former 2nd overall pick from that draft, James is going to have to seriously impress in order to receive a second contract on par with what he's being paid in his final year.

&amp;#x200B;

**James Bouknight**

**22/23 Stats - 5.6/2.1/1.2 on 36/30/67 splits**

It's too soon to write off Charlotte's DUI-doing shooting guard as a bust but when one compares him to his fellow lottery picks from the 2021 draft, even the ones who had their own notable sophomore slumps, Bouknight stands out for all the wrong reasons.  A shooter who can't shoot and rarely available - he played a combined 60 games over the past 2 seasons - the best thing one could say about his prior season was it let the Hornets be bad enough for a high draft pick that will likely come to haunt the franchise for passing over Scoot Henderson as it was used on Brandon Miller instead.  

That last part admittedly wasn't his fault, granted, but the point still stands:  Bouknight is rapidly approaching bust territory and with the addition of the promising Nick Smith Jr. to the roster, James' position in Charlotte's backcourt rotation looks incredibly insecure going into the season.

&amp;#x200B;

**Patrick Williams**

**22/23 Stats - 10.2/4.0/1.2 on 46/42/86 splits**

Another 2020 draftee, Patrick Williams is in perhaps the most precarious position of those mentioned.  Considering that one of these players is on the Hornets, that is saying a lot.  Stuck on a Bulls team trying to contend with DeMar/LaVine/Vucevic all higher in the pecking order that's had a painfully poor record of developing its talent, Williams isn't going to get the same opportunities that others on this list might and his chances of being a tank commander are equally lacking in promise but whatever opportunities he can get, he needs to take them to prove the flashes he's shown are a sign of something greater than he currently is.

  
**Zion Williamson**

**22/23 Stats - 26/7/4.6 on 61/37/71 splits**

When he's on the court, he's an MVP candidate, so Zion doesn't have to prove himself like the above in the same way.  He just has to prove he can stay healthy for most of a given season.  He was on the floor for 29 games last year, missed out on the whole season prior and all but 24 games in his rookie season.  61 games in his sophomore season is his career high and seemingly an exception at that.    


**Ben Simmons**

**22/23 Stats - 6.9/6.3/6.1 on 57/0/44 splits**

It feels weird to list arguably the most accomplished player (Note:  ""Accomplished"" doesn't mean ""best"") on this list at the end but Ben is in a particularly unique circumstance.  On a Brooklyn team that has to build around the margins and a hefty contract that would make it difficult for anyone else to take a flier on him, the former 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team and Jenner enthusiast, one would hope the young socialite will have a healthier season than the past two so we can see if there's a training arc in Ben that leads to the best version of himself. At 27 years old, time is very much against him but it's not as if late blooming point guards like Chauncey Billups and Kyle Lowry are nonexistent.

I probably have LeBron and Jordan above him. 


Larry vs Jokic: Jokic with his 3 year peak, probably surpasses Larry in terms of offense. Larry is the GOAT of the regular season but he has noticeable playoff drops which Jokic rarely has. He's probs better a better offensive player than Larry because of his sustained high efficiency on the floor with less help. Jokic is also a better playoff performer offensively.



Jokic vs Magic: Magic is probably the better playmaker but Jokic is easily the better scorer so I have Jokic over Magic offensively IMO.



Jokic vs Curry: They're both hyper efficient but Jokic is a way better traditional playmaker. I have Jokic slightly ahead offensively.



Jokic vs Kareem: Kareem is a better scorer for his era. Jokic is a better playmaker and it ain't close. But this is a really close one. I'd slightly lean Jokic because he played in a more competitive era.



Jokic vs Shaq: This one is also close. Shaq had more gravity and was more dominant. Both were hyper efficient but Jokic spaced the floor more but you cannot physically stop Shaq. It's a tie for the both of them.



Jokic vs Duncan: Jokic is easily the better offensive player.



Jokic vs Hakeem: Jokic is the better scorer and a better playmaker. Therefore, Jokic is easily the better offensive player.



Jokic vs Wilt: According to Thinking Basketball, Wilt's 50 point season is overrated and eye test wise, Jokic clears. More on that later.



Jokic vs Bill: Not even close.




In conclusion, the Top 5 offensive players are in no order: LeBron, Jordan, Kareem, Shaq, Jokic.


 Jokic is at least a Top 5 offensive player if you consider how great his efficiency is and his brilliant playmaking all together while not having a GOATED supporting cast.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15jd5s0

&gt; On Friday and again Saturday against the U.S. Select Team, Jalen Brunson, Brandon Ingram, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Mikal Bridges started for the national team, which will compete at the FIBA World Cup this month.

&gt;**In Friday’s loss to the Select Team, Cam Johnson was the fifth starter. But in Team USA’s commanding 84-61 win over the Select Team in three, 10-minute periods, Anthony Edwards opened with the starting unit.** The next time the Americans play will be their first exhibition game, at 10:30 p.m. Monday against Puerto Rico, and if consistency in scrimmages means anything the starters will probably come out of those six.

&gt; **“I have nothing set in stone,” Kerr insisted after the Saturday scrimmage.”We’re learning as we go. I thought we learned a lot from yesterday and we’ll learn a lot from today.** It’s great to have these things on tape so we can go back and look at stuff.

&gt;“There will be a lot of really interesting possible combinations just because of the skill these guys have.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Kerr was raving about the passing ability the Americans showed through two scrimmages, and there were a number of context clues from commentary on how Team USA’s collective ball movement has allowed the team to bond quickly. “I think passing does that in general,” Kerr said. “When you have good passers, teams connect quickly. … Brandon Ingram made about four drive-and-kicks yesterday that were incredible plays, leading to wide-open shots. Anthony Edwards has really been moving the ball. And some of these guys have it come so naturally to them, Tyrese (Haliburton), Austin Reaves – these guys are great passers. Jalen from the point guard spot. Mikal as well, and you start adding in the bigs. They’re all of a sudden out of a short roll. We’re getting swings to the perimeter. The whole group is connected and it’s really fun to watch.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Edwards said he’s “ready to play, whatever they ask me to do. “Score the ball, create open shots for others,” Edwards said, when describing what Team USA has asked him to do. “I can get by my man pretty, pretty easily so get by my man, make the team help and you create shots. I also have to defend, rebound, and just, you know, be a voice.”

&gt;Johnson similarly deflected any intent or desire on the starting lineup question, saying “we have guys that are very versatile across the board, and I think that’s just how we want to play.”",t5_2qo4s,t3_15j9gzt

843,"Why don't people put Westbrook in the conversation of ""changing the game""?",nba,"We always hear how Steph changed the game with three-point shooting. But what about Westbrook? He made getting triple doubles popular and since 2016, the number of triple doubles that has been recorded every year has skyrocketed? For instance, Jokic would obviously be generational either way, but would he necessarily *nearly* average a triple double if Westbrook had not been around? Rather than averaging 25/12/10, would his numbers look more like 25/12/7? 

My point is, Westbrook should be credited for showing players that averaging a triple double (or near one) is feasible (and not some ridiculous record that will never be broken like Wilt's 50). I argue that players like Harden, Jokic, Sabonis and even younger players like Ja and LaMelo be as statistically well-rounded and potent if it weren't for Russell Westbrook.  ",t5_2qo4s,t3_15j8xim

864,"""People want to compare me to Michael in his prime, and that's unfair."" - Kobe Bryant (2003)",nba,"At 24, Kobe Bryant has three rings. At that age, Jordan had zero. At 24, Kobe has better all-around court sense, a better J and, unthinkably, even more madly creative mid-air Gumbyness than Jordan did. At 24, Kobe is hitting 38.5% of his treys; Jordan was shooting 18%. Over the last four weeks Kobe was on a mind-warping, pupil-popping, scorched-earth tear during which he scored 35 or more points in 13 straight games. Jordan hadn't done that at 24. Come to think of it, Jordan still hasn't done that.

""He's the best player in the game right now,"" Utah guard Mark Jackson said last week, after Kobe went for 40 points to help the Shaqless Lakers beat the Jazz. ""He's playing basketball that's as  
good as I've seen in my career."" Of course, Jackson's only been in the league for 16 years.

So why can't America embrace Kobe and his ozone-piercing potential? Why can't they realize that falling in love with Kobe doesn't mean breaking up with Michael? I mean, what's not to  
love?

Here's a young man who speaks fluent Italian, is married and has a child, and never shows up in the back of a squad car. Here's a pro who works out eight hours a day in the off-season, who one summer wouldn't go home until he'd made 1,000 jumpers a day. Here's a young god who's runway handsome, GQ cool and Eagle Scout nice.

In Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals in San Antonio last May, he blew up for 12 points in the fourth quarter to beat the Spurs. He was seconds from going live with NBC when he saw a  
small boy crying over the loss. He left the interviewer, went over and hugged the kid. Yet all anybody wants to do is line him up against Jordan and make sure he loses. Kobe's getting sick of  
it, and I don't blame him.

""People want to compare me with Michael in his prime,"" he says, ""and that's unfair. I don't think I'm in my prime yet. I think a player's prime is, like, 26 to 30. I'm only 24. But that's all they want to talk about. They're not saying, 'Kobe worked really hard at getting better at this.' Or, 'This is what I appreciate about Kobe.' It's always what I do in relation to Michael. Like, they say my competitiveness came from watching Michael. It never crossed their minds that I've been like this since I was five.""

Savor this kid. Wallow in his starshine. Be stupefied, mind-boggled, brain-bent. He's writing his legend right under our noses. Beats his man left-hand dribble, skies baseline and flushes over Yao Ming? Catches a long outlet, goes behind his back to lose a Denver Nugget and 360 slams? Driving the baseline, takes off outside the paint, loses Latrell Sprewell in midair and reverse dunks on the far side of the rim? And that's just in the last three weeks.

You want to argue? Bring it.

Jordan never had a Shaq. True, and Kobe never had a Hall of Fame swingman like Scottie Pippen. Or a rebound-munching forward as Dennis Rodman was in his prime. You think he wouldn't be handy to have around? Why, yes, Dennis, I would like to shoot again, thanks!

Jordan won 10 scoring titles. Kobe's got zilch. I watched Kobe score 56 in three quarters against Memphis last season--the man could win a scoring title wearing Muppet slippers. But many nights he has to put his ego in a jar to keep Shaq-Fu happy and well-fed with points. Plus, Kobe has the burden of handling the rock an awful lot--more than Jordan. ""I'm not saying it's harder,"" says Kobe, ""but it consumes a lot more energy, having those little guards crawling on you all the time. It's definitely more running.""

Kobe doesn't D-up like Jordan. True, but he's learning. He's increased his steals from 1.48 a game last season to 2.24 this season. He's averaging a career-best 7.0 rebounds, too. Jordan only beat that once. He's got the Bally's body at 24 that Jordan didn't build until he was 30.

I don't see six rings on Kobe's fingers. Let's say Kobe retires when Jordan will, at 40. That means he'd play 23 seasons. You think Kobe can't get four more rings in the next 16 seasons? ""Seven rings, eight rings, nine rings,"" Kobe says, ""I don't care. I just want to win. Every year.""

Yeah, well, the world will never love Kobe as much as Jordan. True, but maybe that's because Michael came first. If the order had been reversed, would Kobe have the IMAX movies, the jingles  
and the shoes? Would Michael be the one wearing Kobe's throwback at the All-Star Game?

They said nobody would ever punk Ruth's numbers. Then came Aaron.  
They said nobody would go lower than Nicklaus. Then came Tiger.  
Just roll the possibility around on your tongue for a second:  
Kobe Bryant could end up the greatest player in NBA history.

""Ooh,"" says Kobe, ""you just gave me goose bumps.""

The feeling is mutual.

&amp;#x200B;

If guys are so mad at AD and JB getting the bags this summer, let's really consider just how much $$ these players make for their franchises. I believe that the top 5 marketable stars in the league should be making way more money if we really do care about being ""fair"" in regards to what a guy is worth.

&amp;#x200B;

We're talking about star players making 50 million a year, but being more valuable than that through jersey sales, ticket sales, tv coverage, team gear, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My top 10 most marketable stars (guys you'd pay money to see, and can say you've seen them play in 10 years, I know that this isn't a best players list, just a most interesting to see live to the casual fan):

1.Steph Curry

2.Lebron

3.Giannis

4.KD

5.Luka

6.Zion

7.Wemba

8.Jokic

875,Drop your hottest takes in NBA,nba,"Here's mine:

1. You can replace Kobe with any other all star level guard on that 2000s Lakers and they will still win 3 straight. Prime Shaq was THAT dominant

2. Prime Steve Nash is better than any version of CP3, Kidd, and Payton

3. KD is overrated, and cant lead a team. Constantly had insane talent around him and won jack shit apart from two rings while being a part of the best team of all time

4. Bucks' championship window has closed

5. Luka is not winning a chip in Dallas. So does Embiid on the 76ers

6. Zach Lavine deserved the 2016 Dunk Championship. Gordon had a better dunk than Lavine, but you can not argue that Lavine's dunk was not also 50. Gordon ran out of ideas, thats why he lost.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15j1h6y

878,"[Pompey] The problem that Daryl Morey faces is before you had Doc Rivers, who you could blame, you could blame “The Process,” you could blame other people. Right now, all eyes are on Morey ... if they don’t get out of the second round, he’s going to take the blame ... He could be the guy that goes.",nba,"&gt; Scotto: Daryl Morey has shown through his executive tenure with the Sixers and Rockets that he’s always been able to get star players. If Harden is traded, Morey could go all in on cap space for next summer and try to pair another star with Embiid and Maxey as the core going forward. As Morey looks to tinker with Philadelphia’s roster, he’s not an executive who’s gone through a rebuild, so I wonder how long he could stay with the Sixers depending on what happens with the Harden trade and potentially a transformative summer for the team in 2024.

&gt; Pompey: The rhetoric that’s coming out now is if they don’t get it done this year, they’ll have a lot of cap space next year. It sounds like that gives you an extra year to see if you can get things done. The problem that Morey faces is before you had Doc Rivers, who you could blame, you could blame “The Process,” you could blame other people. Right now, all eyes are on Morey. He came here to bring James Harden. He’s also one of the most recognizable front-office executives in pro sports. The fact that he took over a Sixers team, and if they don’t get out of the second round, he’s going to take the blame and the brunt of it. He could be the guy that goes.

&gt; It’s one of those things where they blamed it on the coaching. People felt like the Sixers were a couple of adjustments away from getting out of the second round. Of course, everyone is going to look at the Harden situation. Morey is making a lot of money, and when he came in here, the Sixers were supposed to ascend. When Brett Brown was the coach, it was the second round. When Elton Brand was leading the front office, it was the second round. Now, you’ve got Morey and three max players or close to it in Harden, Embiid, and Tobias Harris, and it’s been three seasons in a row that they ended their season in the second round. I think Morey could be in trouble if they don’t get out of the second round.

885,Best and worst-case scenarios for your team this season?,nba,"For the Mavs:

* **Best case:** The offense remains strong and the defense jumps to average or better. Luka and Kyrie gel well and both make All-NBA, with Luka a top candidate for MVP. Josh Green has a breakout year and is in the running for MIP. Lively has Kessler's impact as a rookie and is starting by midseason. The Mavs finish top 3 in the West with 52+ wins and beat the Suns in 5 in the WCF.
* **Average case:** The team is improved but not enough to be a playoff lock. Luka and Kyrie miss some games now and then for injuries/miscellaneous reasons but not enough to derail the team. The rookies show promise but aren't ready to be rotation players on a contender yet. The Mavs win around 42-44 games and make the playoffs but through the play-in tournament and lose in a hard-fought first round series to Denver.
* **Worst case:** Luka and Kyrie have significant chemistry issues and injury struggles that derail the team's success. Green and Hardy don't show improvement and Lively and OMax look like bad picks, even with future considered. Late in the season the Mavs shut it down and tank to keep their top 10 protected pick again.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15izikf

So you compare Ray Allen to Jaylen Brown, Brown is better. Paul Peirce and Tatum, Tatum is better. Kevin Garnett and Kristaps? I think KG has the edge but it's not by a whole lot. Porzingis is a better scorer but he's not better on defense. 

If Kristaps Porzingis plays at least 50 games, the Celtics will be the best team in the league. It is insane how how underrated KP has become. All he has to do is try a little harder on defense and he's a top 20 player in the nba.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15iu1hd

929,Who would you rather have as your best player for a playoff run on a team that has a top 10-15 player as its #2: Anthony Davis or Jimmy Butler,nba,"The consensus that I've seen is that AD &gt; Jimmy, however Jimmy has shown repeatedly that he's capable of taking less than stellar teams to the Finals as the lead guy and driving force.

Jimmy has never had that second option that can take the pressure off of him during his tenure in Miami, whereas Davis has LeBron (who can be argued as their #1). This has led to Miami being outclassed in both Finals.

So, assuming that this hypothetical team has that secondary scorer, who would you have?",t5_2qo4s,t3_15ihkkb
930,Who is the best player to never get their jersey retired?,nba,"When teams who have few rings earn one, they often give props to nearly the entire starting line-up, and some times bench players. 

The Pistons, for example, have retired jerseys for Zeke, Dumars, Laimbeer, Rodman, and even Vinnie Johnson (poor Mark Aquirre). They've also retired Big Ben's number, and RIP's, and Chauncy's (poor Sheed and Prince). 

And even marquee names like Davie Bing and Bob Lanier got their numbers up. 

This goes across the board. Barkley has his number up in the rafters in Philly and Phoenix. 

But some important role players (like Kenny Smith, Sam Cassell, Mad Max, and Horry in Houston) don't get so much love, and even former All-Stars who won rings, like Otis Thorpe, don't get a jersey in the rafter (though Drexler did).

&amp;#x200B;

And some HOFers don't have a jersey retired at all.

The best one that comes to mind is McGrady. Splitting his time between so many teams and never seeing any playoff success certainly puts a dent in his options. 

But that got me thinking: Who is the BEST player to never get his jersey retired ANYWHERE? 

And to make it interesting, try putting together an All-Non-Jersey-Retired starting line-up. ",t5_2qo4s,t3_15ihkiw

936,Hottest Thunder Take of the Summer,nba,"I don't see a lot of differences in terms of talent at each role between the Thunder and the Grizzlies. The Thunder could be the second best team in the West next year. The Grizzlies were 2nd in the West by a solid margin over a scrappy Kings team.

Consider:


Shai = Morant


Chet/Dort = Adams/JJJ (most egregious error, I know, this is a hot take)


Jdub = Bane


Giddey = Smart




Now, maybe it's the defense that is lacking. But I see a lot of upside in continuity. Smart is a great defender, but the Celtics were kind of his team in a way. The defense was anchored on him. In Memphis, I think they have to figure it out. 


Also, on the group of talls and Dort: Chet will shoot and make as many  3's as JJJ. I think they will have similar blocks. I think JJJ is WAY BETTER than Chet as a rookie this year. However, Dort is a top tier guard-anyone player in the league.  With solid rim protection help coming from Chet, Dort is going to be even better. JJJ and Adams also protect the rim. All four players rebound their asses off. I think, for the purpose of this argument, it's a wash. Adams is a one-man offensive rebounding machine, and he contributes greatly to winning with screens. I doubt Chet will screen as effectively, as Adams, who is the best, but he will be serviceable for SGA as a pick-and-roll partner in a similar way to the Morant/Adams PNR.  

Giddey and Smart are both great playmakers. Where Giddey has a size advantage, Smart has a dribbling advantage. Similar 3-pt % for the two is my prediction. Smart probably shoots 2x the attempts. 


And  now for the best part: JDUB. This kid is a fucking all-time legend. The night man cometh. It was funny how at first   he was adjusting to NBA speed, and then he just hit a player improvement trajectory like a fucking rocket ship to outer space. I mean, he was taking over games. Straight up, Jdub can ball. I would never trade him for Bane, a max-contract player now, if you gave me 2 future firsts on top. Untouchable. Bane got that dog in him, but Jdub got the GOAT in him.

Here's the meat of the article

*Nowitzki, however, sounds genuinely glad that he’ll be enshrined with Wade. Nowitzki said he and Wade “actually bonded” in Houston in early April when the Hall Class of ‘23 was announced.*

*“Obviously we’ve gone through a lot, some ups and downs,” Nowitzki said. “But at the end of the day he is one of the greatest players ever to play the game, so it’s an honor to have him in the class.”*

*In 2006, the Mavericks certainly weren’t thrilled that a steady Wade parade to the free-throw line (97 attempts!) factored heavily into Miami’s comeback. And Nowitzki didn’t appreciate Wade and LeBron James* [***mocking and seemingly calling into question his 102-degree fever***](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2014/06/13/nowitzki-recalls-being-mocked-by-lebron-dwyane-wade-in-2011-i-just-didnt-think-it-was-funny/) *in Game 4 of the 2011 Finals, calling their behavior “childish.”*

*Nowitzki is 45 now. Wade is 41. The gradual thawing of their differences showed when,* [***after playing their final game against one another***](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2019/03/29/dirk-nowitzki-dwyane-wade-finale-featured-thrilling-co-main-event-with-a-pair-of-slovenians/) *on Feb. 13, 2019 in American Airlines Center, Wade asked Nowitzki for a jersey swap.*

*If any hard feelings lingered in the next four years, they seemingly were buried in Houston four months ago.*

*“We sat together with his family during one of the dinners, and we talked,” Nowitzki said. “And so I think it’s going to be great. I think there’s a lot of mutual respect there now.*

*“I know we’ve gone through some stuff in our careers, but at the end of the day not everybody you compete against at the highest level can be friends. It’s just not how it works.*

*“I think there were some things said on both sides that weren’t liked by the other side, but you know what? This is 20-something years later now, almost. So there’s really now hard feelings, and it’s gonna be a fun week with him.”*",t5_2qo4s,t3_15if871

His strength allows him box out just about anyone other than the absolute biggest centers like Drummond, and he has the size, length, and timing to snatch key rebounds when it seems nobody else can get a hand on it. He also has really good instincts for anticipating the direction of the rebound.

&gt; Thursday, when asked about the possibility of Las Vegas being home to an NBA team, Team USA coach Steve Kerr enthusiastically supported the idea, adding he felt similarly about the league returning to Seattle.

&gt; **""It feels right,"" Kerr said. ""Obviously it's not my department, but Vegas and Seattle seem to be such smart franchises. It's a shame that we ever lost the Sonics in the first place. But as you look forward and you think of what we need, we need a couple of Western time slots. Think about all the doubleheaders on TV you have where the second game is starting at 8:40 central time. We lost a couple of West Coast time slots back when Seattle and Vancouver left the league. It hurt the TV schedule, which hurt the whole league schedule.**

&gt; ""You factor in Vegas for the time slot. But also just how great of a venue this is for summer league, USA basketball, the fans here have proven they'll come out, they love the Aces. The Knights just won the Stanley Cup, the Raiders are filling it up every Sunday. So this seems like a really good next team.""

&gt;Kerr's answer led to a funny exchange with a reporter who brought up to the coach that the Final Four would be held in Las Vegas this upcoming season.

&gt;When Kerr said he didn't realize the NCAA tournament Final Four would be in Las Vegas, it was quickly clarified by the reporter that the final four in question was actually the NBA's first in-season tournament, with the semifinals and championship game set for Dec. 7 and 9.

&gt;With a sheepish smile and ensuing laughter from the assembled media, Kerr said, ""I forgot about that.""",t5_2qo4s,t3_15idyfs

https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2010.html

13.1 mpg is a pretty high number. Most teams each year have ~3-5 players who average less than 10 mpg; these players just get in at garbage time mostly.

The unique thing about that 09-10 Warriors team was just how truly decimated they were by injuries throughout that season (and their refusal to sign players to fill in). So, if you got in the game, you were usually going to play ~20 min. (or 48, if you judge by game 82 that year)

950,"[OC] How a basketball simulation engine ranks the best players of all time. AKA ""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!""",nba,"""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!"" Well, what if it was? 

The website WhatIfSports allows users to build their own virtual basketball teams from any season of any player in NBA/ABA history. Your virtual team will play simulated games against other teams, where every single possession of every single game is simulated for a new season of virtual basketball. **The engine uses real life results from players to simulate new possessions.** There are leagues of virtual teams that play 82 simulated games plus playoffs. As an avid WIS player, looking at all players' stats under a microscope has given me an interesting perspective. 

I have been playing on WiS for close to 10 years, and have decided to share some of what I learned here. **I do not believe that this is the actual all-time rankings of these players.** But this is roughly how players (or rather the results of players' regular season stats) look to the eyes of a simulation engine. ***This is who The SIM thinks the greatest players of all time are.*** 
_________________________________________
###Identifying the top players through a statistical lens. The best players: according to WhatIfSports' Simulation Engine.
_________________________________________
**The methodology:** 

There are lots of different game formats for WhatIfSports. Most of them involve a salary cap. We're not looking at data from those leagues; it would skew the data with an extra variable. Most formats also involve selecting the best season and only the best season of a player's career, which skews data towards players who peaked for one season; I also do not want this data, as it just looks at one year. So for this exercise, I will be looking at data from the ""Savage League""; which has no salary cap, and uses the 5 best seasons of a player's career (doesn't have to be consecutive)
&gt;**This allows us to identify the 5-best statistical years of players' careers.** So not quite ""best careers"", and not quite ""best peaks"" (since the 5 seasons don't have to be consecutive), but somewhere in-between. 


The Savage League is a draft league that has each of 24 users draft 12 players (288 total NBA/ABA players) and then assemble 5 unique teams that each contain one unique season of each of your 12 players. So if you draft Michael Jordan, you pick 5 of his seasons and put one on each of your 5 teams, and repeat for your other 11 players (with a lot more strategy involved that I don't need to get into.) and pit your 5 teams against 23 GMs who each have 5 teams. You set your lineups and set some basic strategy, and then the website will simulate matchups over the course of 82 games + playoffs against other users. Every season of every player in NBA history is eligible to be drafted, and trust me, we scour the obscure guys to find any advantage we can. 

I have participated in this league since it's inception, and I have lots of first hand knowledge, but I will mostly be relying on **ADP** (average draft position) plus the **results of the simulated teams** that had these players. So basically we will be working with a **modified ADP that bumps players up or down a bit based on how many wins the team that drafted them usually gets.** There is 11 seasons worth of data. 
____________________________________

Okay, let's look how this website/method is and isn't perfect. 

**What *isn't* a problem:**

- **Era-normalization:** This is not really a problem. We (the GMs) and the website (the ""Sim"") look at things in a *""per possession""* context. Usage rate, eFG%, foul draw rate, AST%, TO%, OREB%, DREB%, yada yada. All per-possession. So if Player A and Player B played in two separate eras with two vastly different paces, the stats will normalize that accordingly. 
&gt;Example: we don't care about how many rebounds a player grabbed per game. We don't even care how many rebounds a player grabbed per36; we care about what % of available rebounds that player was able to grab.
&gt;&gt;There is also a small adjustment made to all players' 2FG% and 3FG% based on the average effectiveness of the era, and the website even approximated 3PM of players who played pre-3pt era, as well as approximating blocks/steals/etc for eras where that info wasn't tracked. It's not perfect, but it's not as big as a problem as you probably assumed it was, and I don't think there's a better solution out there. 

- **User/human biases:** I don't think this is a problem. We all pay $50 to play a season of Savage simply for bragging rights of winning the league, and the two worst finishers have to sit out the next time around. A user will rarely ever draft a player just because he/she likes them. We're all trying to make the best teams. Even if there is some human bias in selection, I am weighing the results by actual wins in the sim, and the sim has no bias. 
&gt;Example: I have drafted both Karl Malone and Miles Bridges even though I dislike both of them. It's all about winning, baby. 

- **Roster Fit/Chemistry:** This isn't a problem. You have to build teams to compliment your other players' strengths. This isn't like a fantasy basketball team where you just sum the raw ""points"" your players produced. You still need to have a good balance of passing/spacing/rebounding/defense/positional versatility/bench/etc etc on your team. The engine is simulating what it thinks would happen if your players were on the court at the same time against your opponent's players. 
&gt;Example: If you have Amare plus 3 good passers like Magic, Bird, and Draymond, then your Amare will probably score a higher FG% than he did in real life. If you put players who barely pass around Amare and make him create for himself, it would be lower. 
&gt;&gt;Even though Draymond Green, Ben Simmons, Rajon Rondo, Ben Wallace, and Dennis Rodman are all great players in this format, you can't game the system by putting them all on the same team. Everyone would pack the paint on D against you and you'd struggle to score.  

**What actually *is* a problem with this methodology:** 

- **Style of play is nearly-invisible to the stats:** The sim has no way of knowing that a player like Melo or Barkley would eat away the shotclock on ISOs. It just sees what % of possessions the player used, and what the results of those possessions were, and how the players around them might affect it. Unlike a video game, there's no physical attribute ""speed"", ""agility"", etc ratings.

- **Defensive ratings are imperfect:** While most of the numbers on a player's card are based on their actual real-life stats, there is one semi-arbitrary number: defense. The website assigns a 0-100 score for every player's defense, and there is some human error in this one component. All-D and DPOY awards boost this score. There's a lot of accuracy in some instances. But for some players, the ratings are inaccurate. 
&gt;Also, the website doesn't have a way to differentiate if a player is good at certain aspects of defense (on ISOs vs help, on perimeter vs paint, rotations, etc), just if they're good/average/bad at D overall, and how effective they are at guarding each position.

- **Teammate boosts:** DeAndre Jordan shot over 70% in 3 of his seasons that he played with Chris Paul. The website has no way to separate how good he would have been in a vacuum/without Chris Paul in those seasons. So DeAndre Jordan is a very very very good player in the Sim and we don't know how accurate that would be. It's not as big of a problem as you're imagining. He still only shoots roughly as often as he did irl, so he's still just a putback &amp; lob type of guy in the Sim. If you paired him with say Jordan Clarkson as his PG in the sim, his numbers would drop significantly, just like in real life. But it is a small issue. 

- **The Sim can't see invisible things** like well-set screens, boxing out, etc. This means that Brook Lopez is considered a bad rebounder in the sim. In real life, we know that he helps his team secure rebounds even though he doesn't grab them often himself. This could be solved if someone ever made a more complex sim that looked at on-floor/off-floor ratings too. It also doesn't factor in clutch rankings, mental toughness, etc. 

**Gray area problems** These are things that I don't think are a problem but someone might argue that they are:

- **Era-styles:** Up above I explained how everything is pace-normalized and how efficiency is era-adjusted. The one caveat to that is that 3-point attempt rates are going to stay what they were. In real life, Larry Bird never made more than 90 3s in a season. Some people might say ""if he played today, he'd attempt 600 per season!"" Well, he didn't. I think trying to make him shoot more 3s on-paper than he did irl would lead to more problems than it solves, but just putting this here for anyone who has this thought/question. 

- **Minutes:** Players can only play roughly the amount of minutes that they played in real life before they start to get ""fatigued"" or injured. You could argue that if a bench player was given more opportunity, they could play more minutes just fine. I could argue that if we took all of the elite low-MPG guys and could play them starter minutes without penalties, Boban would be a top 50 player. I think it's better the way that it is. 
________________________

**With that said, here are the highlights of the rankings:**

**1. LeBron James.** In this world, this isn't ever even a debate. He's #1 in this by a good margin. We've even discussed making his 6-10th best seasons a separate draftable player, and most people agree that version would be a top 5 pick if so. 

**2-6: Wilt Chamberlain, Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, Giannis, Kareem.** Roughly in that order. 

**7-9: Shaq, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul.** All three of these guys usually get drafted around here, and interestingly their teams all win about the same amount as each other on average. 

**10-18: David Robinson, Karl Malone, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Charles Barkley, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird.** Jokic is very divisive among us right now. His offensive stats are INSANE (I don't think the average NBA fan still understands how insane), but his defense is the worst out of every player you'd be considering in the first round. Gobert's numbers are phenomenal when looked at this way, and I think more of Utah's success from those years should be attributed to him by the average fan. Kawhi is the winningest player in this format and he keeps moving up. He used to be drafted around 28th but keeps winning and keeps getting drafted higher. A lot of his benefits are hard to notice at first glance. 

**19-24: Anthony Davis, DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan** For what it's worth, teams picking around here usually win more than those picking at the beginning (snake draft). These are all really good players in this format. 

**25-33: Julius Erving, Dwyane Wade, John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Ben Wallace, Scottie Pippen, Artis Gilmore, Moses Malone, Kevin McHale** Dr J has been quite successful lately, his teams have been winning a lot. 

From this point on I'll just drop in a few highlights: 

**Damian Lillard** has been going around 35th lately and has seen a lot of success on his teams at that selection, meaning he's going to start going even higher soon. He's very efficient. 

**Bill Russell** is about 40th. He has a great defensive rating and grabs a ton of boards (but not as many as he did irl due to pace-adjusting), but he is extremely inefficient at scoring, even with an era-adjusted boost. He's a decent passer, but when you look at it through the eyes of a per-possession lens, it's not nearly as impressive as his raw ""assist per game"" stats. For instance: in 64-65, he had 5.3 assists per game, but he also played 44.4 MPG at a really high possession pace. When you look at the same season at a per possession basis, he was getting assists at the same clip as 22-23 Jarred Vanderbilt.

**Shawn Marion** (~50th), **Bobby Jones** (~60th), **Horace Grant** (~65th), **Andrei Kirilenko** (~75th), **Sidney Moncrief** (~80th) are all examples of guys who don't get talked about enough in NBA circles who are really really freaking good. Go look up their BBallRef pages. They're all beasts in this format. I don't think it's a coincidence that all of them were on lots of winning teams in real life. 

**Manu** goes about 60th and **Tony Parker** rarely gets drafted, but will get drafted at about 240th if he does. Manu's per possession stats are insane.

**Dirk** goes around 150th usually. His scoring efficiency isn't as great as you'd think. His defense isn't great. His offensive rebounds are extremely low for a big man. He didn't shoot as many 3s as you imagine. He's a good, clean, player (great FTs, low TOs and fouls), but when you look at the numbers this way, he's several tiers below Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Charles Barkley, and Kevin Garnett. **Chris Webber** is about 200th. 

**Kobe** is about 60th. He's just far too inefficient to be a first or second rounder, but he can be a good pick in the 3rd round with the right team around him. (**Pau Gasol** is about 90th, **Bynum** is about 140th, and **Odom** is about 250th, for what it's worth)

**Oscar Robertson** goes around 40th. He's a lot more efficient than most guys from his era. His rebound and assist numbers are not nearly as impressive in a per-possession context though. 

**Russell Westbrook** is about 150th. He can single handedly tank your efficiency and TOs, but if you have the right pieces around him, he can be a contributor on a winning team. I'm not sure if the average fan understands truly how different his efficiency is vs someone like Steph. For context, Westbrook rebounds and assists at a much much higher rate than the Big O (when looked at per possession, not per game), but Oscar is still good at both while being a more efficient scorer who turns the ball over far less. 

**Walt Frazier** goes about 60th. **Willis Reed** is about 110th. 

**Grant Hill** usually gets drafted around 200th but is also the worst performer out of the entire field. His teams lose the most often. I think his eye test looks a lot better than his on-paper results. 

**Allen Iverson** is undraftable/unplayable. For a quick example, his 02-03 season has roughly the same usage as 22-23 SGA, but with 10% lower eFG, equal AST%, higher TO%, lower REB%, lower combined STL+BLK%, and lower FT% by 13%. The only thing he's better at than 22-23 SGA is that he fouls less. And SGA is only ranked about 180th in this environment. This isn't a human assigning a higher 2K rating to one player. These are his actual, real-life numbers. You could argue that his era was more inefficient, but AI actually has the lowest eFG% of all players with starter-minutes from that 02-03 season. So he was even extremely inefficient compared to his peers. Just an observation. 

**Paul George, Dikembe, Luka, Gary Payton, Embiid, Jason Kidd** are all around the same tier (~45th-55th) as either elite role players or good 2nd options on offense. If the fit is right, they can be your 2nd best player on a contender. If you get them in the 3rd, you're ecstatic. 

**Carmelo** is about 200th. He's okay as a bench player for a couple of seasons (in this context). His scoring wasn't as efficient as you'd imagine, and he wasn't good at anything else. 

**Drexler** and **Ewing** both go ~90th.

**Steve Nash** goes around 50th but his teams often perform poorly. His eFG, AST%, and TO% are all elite but man...he is a big fat negative on D and on boards. 

**Bill Walton** routinely goes around 50-60 even though he has extremely low minutes due to injury. He was that good when he did play. 

**Penny Hardaway** is about 75th all-time even though he can't contribute much due to injuries/low minutes outside of 1-2 seasons. He was also very good in the short time he was healthy. 

**Victor Oladipo** goes about 180th solely off the strength of that one good Indiana season (contributing nothing on the other 4 that you have to use him). Very strong season that stands up in a historical context. Nothing playable outside of that. 

**Brent Barry** and **Donyell Marshall** (not the washed-up version from the Cavs FYI) are both top-100 players in this format. I don't think many people understood advanced stats in that era, so people were sleeping on both of them. 

**Ben Simmons** is a top 90 player all-time in this context. Again, this can't account for him chickening out in crunch time, but I still think people forgot how good he was ~5 years ago. He is a very good player by advanced metrics. **KAT** is another example of this. He's a top-50 player of all time in this context. Again, the sim can't pick up on his ""softness"" or lack of star power in crunchtime, but I don't think people realize how good his scoring efficiency is historically (since most people look at FG%/traditional splits instead of eFG% or TS%)

Modern guys who rank higher than you'd imagine (remember, this is all-time): **Jrue Holiday** (~50), **Bam Adebayo** (~55), **Jimmy Buckets** (~55), **Draymond Green** (~65), **Al Horford** (~100), **Danny Green** (~100), **Michael Porter Jr** (~120), **Mike Conley** (~130), **Pascal Siakam** (~150). When you look at how often their teams win irl, it could be argued that they really do actually produce close to this value.

Random wing dump: **Luka** is about 50th. **Klay** is about 60th. **Gerald Wallace** is about 100th. **Ray Allen** is about 100th. **Jason Tatum** is about 120th. **Bradley Beal** is about 140th. **Paul Pierce** is about 150th. **Chris Mullin** is about 160th. **Reggie Miller** is about 200th. **T Mac** goes about 200th. **Vince Carter** goes about 200th but teams he gets drafted on have a high winning % so I think he should be top 150. 

Random PG dump: **Gary Payton** is about 50th. **Chauncey Billups** and **Deron Williams** are both about 90th. **Lowry** is about 100th. **Mark Price** goes at about 130. **Lonzo** actually goes higher (~140th) than **LaMelo** (~200th) usually. **Jose Calderon** goes about 160th, his efficiency was crazy. 

Random big dump (maybe there's a better phrase?): **Shawn Kemp** ~55th. **Ibaka** ~70th. **Jonas V** actually goes ~80th. **Amare** ~100th. **K Love** ~120. **Carlos Boozer** ~140

**Zion** goes top 200 every single time, even though he BARELY has minutes. He's that good in the few minutes he does play.  

**Tyrese Haliburton** goes ~100th in this format even though he can only contribute for 2/5 seasons and even though he hasn't hit his prime yet. He's going to be a top 40 player on this list someday. Maybe higher. **Walker Kessler** is already a stud in this format as well. 

Players in the real-life NBA top-75 who wouldn't even sniff the top-250 of this format (alphabetical by last name): **Nate Archibald, Paul Arizin, Rick Barry, Elgin Baylor, Dave Bing, Bob Cousy, Dave DeBusschere, Hal Greer, Elvin Hayes, Allen Iverson, Sam Jones, Pete Maravich, George Mikan, Earl Monroe, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Bill Sharman, Isiah Thomas, Nate Thurmond, Lenny Wilkens, Dominique Wilkins.**

Surprise guys who do make the list (all of these guys routinely get drafted, but usually not in the top 200. But all are better than some NBA Top-75 team guys in this format): **Kirk Hinrich, Patrick Beverley, Marvin Williams, Fat Lever, Gary Payton II, Charlie Ward, Joe Ingles, Taj Gibson, James Johnson, Nate McMillan, Nic Batum, Eddie Jones, Nic Claxton**

Guys who rarely get talked about on /r/NBA who are relevant in our sim-world: **Larry Nance Sr** (~60th), **Buck Williams** (~75), **Chris Boucher** (~120), **Delon Wright** (~150), **Jamario Moon** (~160), **Daniel Gafford** (~160), **Kyle O' Quinn** (~160), **Hot Rod Williams** (~200), **Tom Boerwinkle** (~200), **Bill Bridges** (~200), **Clarence Weatherspoon** (~240), **Don Buse** (~240), **Larry Sanders** (~240), **Dana Barros** (240), **Bobby Phills** (240) - most of these are elite role players. If we have our usage covered, we're looking for someone who can contribute without taking up any possessions. 

Conclusions: Obviously this isn't perfect. I am in no way saying that this is actually what these players' all-time rankings are/should be. However, I am saying we can learn something from it. Dwight is a top-10 player all-time by the numbers when you neutralize eras with per-possesion stats, and combined with his awards and accolades, I do think he absolutely should have made the top-75 team. 

I do think that we miss a lot of things with the eye-test. You probably think Ben Wallace (~35th) and Bam Adebayo (~55) are way too high on this list, and they probably are. I would also argue that we usually have them too low on our human-made lists. Look at their real-life successes. With players like these, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle of the two. Adebayo was the 1B on 2 teams that went to the finals. I do think we should consider him a lot better than we do. Not 55th best of all time good. But he's probably a more impactful player than most people realize. Similarly, while I do think that Westbrook and A.I. are top-100 players of all-time, I do think they're a little overrated. The stats back that up. 

If you are thinking ""well how can ___ be so low if his team won X games/made the finals in real life"", I will tell you that the SIM would probably come up with similar results often for most historical matchups of that player's team vs his competition, but that you're probably undervaluing certain players on those teams and overvaluing others. Again, it's not perfect and doesn't 100% reflect reality, but I think guys like Ben Wallace and Dikembe Mutombo were more valuable in the 00s than most realize. 

Anyway, if you're a big old nerd, come join us. Feel free to message me if you want to build some virtual teams as a GM and want tips/advice. There are even formats where you can draft and trade every offseason. I don't work for them or anything. Just bored and it's the offseason.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15iazbp

Just a quick question about the NBA goat debate, online I see it’s between 2 people, Lebron James and Michael Jordan, the sentiment seems to be that Michael Jordan is still the GOAT (feel free to tell me if I’m wrong) though there are people that argue both sides.

In soccer there’s a debate between Messi and Ronaldo. Comparing both players through stats, Trophies and eye test will show that there’s a clear winner however there is still of course a debate. 

Now here’s my question, is the debate the same for basketball? What I mean is that one player is obviously better than the other but the debate exists because people can’t look past someone they idolise or is the NBA GOAT discussion more intelligent and nuanced?

I’m curious to see how these types of debates are handled outside of soccer basically. Thanks.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15i7ql3

967,"SGA, Ant, or Ja",nba,"It’s the offseason so you know what time is. Start, bench, and cut. How would you organize these players. All of these players are aspiring stars in the NBA and have already impressed fans. They each have a lot of career left to play so these comparisons are VERY early. SGA had his breakout season this year becoming an all star and making first team all-nba. Ant had a very impressive year making the all star team and averaging career highs. Ja has recently been under heavy scrutiny for his off the court antics however his resume of 2x all star, all-nba, ROY, and most improved, with solid playoff performances can’t be denied.

970,Why are people constantly overestimating the value of the Dejounte Murray trade?,nba,"Bit of a rant from a peeved Hawks fan.

There is a thread that is getting a lot of responses talking about which team is in the worst position in the league. One of the names which was brought up was the Hawks, in which many people talked about the value given up for DJM (all star tier player) had handicapped their future

This has also been a common occurrence in which people compare this trade with the Gobert trade which is...nuts.

I don't know if it's because ATL is not a popular team, or because people confuse the two because they happened close to eachother, but  can we look at some facts here?

What the Hawks gave up:
 
2025 and 2027 1st
2026 Swap
2023 1st (from NY)
Danillo Gallinari 

Ok, let's break this down: The two unprotected picks are the big value pieces here. 2025 and 2027 will likely be years into both Trae and DJ's prime years, so if everything goes well they won't be worth much. But NBA teams are always on the lookout for implosion. So that's value.

2026 swap - theoretically, what is the value here? Given the timeline of Wemby and Trae, you could say either that both teams will be around the same level (Trae + some help has proven to be a baseline of atleast 40 wins and a playoff berth the last 3 years), or you could argue that the Hawks would be better. But I'm not seeing the scenario where the Hawks are demonstrably worse to the point that this matters.

2023 1st - A pick the Hawks got from NY for Cam Reddish. Not their own pick at all. A straight up bonus which saved them from trading one down the line. A great piece to include in the deal, actually. Really hurt them I bet.

Gallo - Salary filler out of the league.

All in all, the Hawks essentially gave up 2 firsts for an all-star level player. Really emptied the clip, huh?

They kept both their 2023 and 2024 picks as well, one of which was just  used on Kobe Bufkin. 


Maybe I'm biased due to being a Hawks homer. But can someone explain what the big overwhelming cost of this deal was? Oh, and the Hawks just signed DJM to one of the best contracts in the NBA and locked him in until the end of the pick exchanges if he's not traded.

Really killed the franchise guys. Brush up and do your homework please.",t5_2qo4s,t3_15i6i6h
