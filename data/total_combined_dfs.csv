# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3,39725,6053,"2023 Offseason Review: San Francisco 49ers#San Francisco 49ers Offseason Review

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

-----|--------|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs."

"NFL considers alternatives to the kickoff, including the XFL model",nfl,"&gt;In the XFL, the kick happens at the 30 yard line. Other than the kicker, the players on the kicking team are aligned at the receiving team’s 35 yard line. Ten of the receiving team’s players are positioned five yards away. Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players.

"The only quarterbacks ranked ahead of Kirk Cousins for the NFL Top 100 from the 2022-2023 season are Herbert, Allen, Hurts, Burrow, and Mahomes. Is that a fair ranking?",nfl,"Reminder that the top 100 is based off of a poll of NFL players voting on their peers *based on the most recent NFL season.* This is not a ranking of the best players going into the next season. This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|

|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,25345,4470,"NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023**Layout:**

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton.

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started."
"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

|Chris Moore|WR|Houston Texans|1 Year|$1.3 Million
|Trevon Wesco|TE|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$1.2 Million
|Chris Hubbard|RT|Cleveland Browns|1 Year|???

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break. 



___

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

|Naquan Jones|DT|1-year RFA tender|$940k

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

|Chris Moore|WR|Houston Texans|1 Year|$1.3 Million
|Trevon Wesco|TE|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$1.2 Million
|Chris Hubbard|RT|Cleveland Browns|1 Year|???

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

2023 Offseason Review Series: Green Bay Packers,nfl,"# Coaching Changes

This offseason, the Packers allowed defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, whom Rasul Douglas credits with his turnaround from a practice squad castoff into a legit player, to walk to Atlanta, while they promoted safeties coach Ryan Downard to DB coach, and hiring Greg Williams from Arizona as their defensive passing game coordinator (no relation to Bountygate architect Gregg Williams). Rich Bisaccia was named assistant head coach in addition to his role as special teams coordinator, while outside linebackers coach Jason Rebrovich was promoted to pass rush specialist. They also hired some additional names (Tim Lester, senior analyst, Rob Grosso, offensive quality control, Kyle Wilber, special teams quality control).

# Projected Starting Lineup

## Offense

* QB: Jordan Love
* RB: Aaron Jones, AJ Dillon
* WR: Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed (slot), Samori Toure
* TE: Luke Musgrave, Josiah Deguara, Tucker Kraft
* LT: David Bakhtiari
* LG: Elgton Jenkins
* C: Josh Myers
* RG: Jon Runyan Jr.
* RT: Zach Tom

## Defense

* EDGE: Rashan Gary, Preston Smith, Lukas Van Ness
* IDL: Kenny Clark, Devonte Wyatt, TJ Slaton
* ILB: De’Vondre Campbell, Quay Walker, Isaiah McDuffie
* CB: Jaire Alexander, Eric Stokes, Rasul Douglas, Keisean Nixon (nickel)
* S: Darnell Savage, Jonathan Owens

## Projected 53-man, Training camp battles, Strengths and weaknesses

* QB (2): Jordan Love, Sean Clifford

*Training camp battles to watch:* It’s a fight between rookie Sean Clifford and USFL MVP Alex McGough, and Brian Gutekunst loves his draft picks. Last year, all eleven of his draft selections in April made his final 53 man roster, and expect Clifford to have a massive advantage coming in because of this, even if he were bad. Clifford has been good at camp though, and those who are watching have said he displays more zip on his throws than he did in college. Could it have been a coaching issue?

*Strength/Weakness?:* The lack of a vet backup is concerning, and it's fair to say that the Packers QB room is at least a huge question mark, if not a weakness. But in terms of matching the numbers of last year's performance, Jordan Love's job of being better than 2022 Aaron Rodgers (with a broken thumb) is not too difficult: Rodgers failed to hit 300 yards passing in any game last year.

* RB (3): Aaron Jones, AJ Dillon, Tyler Goodson

*Training camp battles to watch:* It will be interesting to see if any in a group that includes last year’s UDFA Tyler Goodson, returning vet Patrick Taylor, and seventh-round rookie Lew Nichols will be the third RB on the depth chart, if they make it at all. Brian Gutekunst kept just two on the initial 53 man roster last year. Nichols has missed some time with injuries during camp.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Fair to say Packers have one of, if not the, best running back tandem in football. Aaron Jones has been a dynamic playmaker every year he's been in Matt LaFleur's offense, and he's been pretty blessed with good health in that time. AJ Dillon is a thumping downhill runner, and he consistently gets a yard or two more than most backs would thanks to his size and strength. Expect Green Bay to lean into the run game, and lean into it a lot, to help out their young QB.

* WR (6): Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Samori Toure, Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks, Malik Heath

*Training camp battles to watch:* Packers coaches are raving about second-year pro Samori Toure, and it will be a question whether he or rookie Jayden Reed will get more snaps as the third receiver. On the other hand, it looks to be an uphill battle for rookie Grant DuBose to make the roster as he missed minicamp with injuries, all while undrafted free agent Malik Heath has impressed as he has run some reps with the first-team offense, something not even Wicks has managed to do.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Packers have the cheapest, youngest WR room in the NFL, with Christian Watson being the most seasoned vet here. Him and Doubs will need to make second-year leaps for this room to be considered a strength by any stretch of the imagination. 

* TE (4): Luke Musgrave, Josiah Deguara, Tucker Kraft, Tyler Davis

*Training camp battles to watch:* Will rookie Luke Musgrave immediately catapult to the top of the depth chart? Coaches and teammates have heaped praise onto just how fast and smooth he looks on the field. Or will third-year tight end Josiah Deguara, the most experienced pass catcher on the roster, start the season as TE1?

*Strength/Weakness?:* Just like the WR room, the TEs here are among the youngest in the NFL. TEs are also usually much more difficult to onboard than WRs, so look to some growing pains here as the rookies get their welcome to the NFL moments throughout the season.

* OL (9): David Bakhtiari, Yosh Nijman, Zach Tom, Caleb Jones, Jon Runyan Jr., Josh Myers, Elgton Jenkins, Royce Newman

*Training camp battles to watch:* Assuming Bakhtiari is healthy, it will be a fight between fifth-year former UDFA Yosh Nijman and second-year tackle Zach Tom to be the starter at right tackle. And if Nijman wins that fight, prepare to see the talented Tom, who played at every spot but center in his rookie year, to give third-year center Josh Myers a serious run for his money there. Bakhtiari, Jenkins and fourth-year guard Runyan all likely have their starting spots locked up, but there’s going to be a serious squeeze to be a backup interior lineman among third-year guard Royce Newman, second-year lineman Sean Rhyan, and fourth-year guard Jake Hanson, of which only two, maybe possibly just one, will make the roster.

*Strength/Weakness?:* When healthy, the left side of the line (with David Bakhtiari and Elgton Jenkins) is the best in football, and there's no question about it. And despite the struggles of center Josh Myers (in run blocking, primarily), expect the Packers offensive line to still be a strength overall, as they should give Jordan Love a comfortable time in the pocket if they can stay healthy. 

* EDGE (5): Rashan Gary, Preston Smith, Lukas Van Ness, Kingsley Enagbare, Brenton Cox Jr.

*Training camp battles to watch:* It's not a battle with a player, but Rashan Gary's timeline for his return from a season-ending ACL tear will determine the success of the Packers defense early on. He was activated from the PUP list yesterday. Preston Smith is likely solidified in his role as the number two pass rusher behind Gary, though behind him, it'll be a battle between second-year OLB Kingsley Enagbare and the rookie Lukas Van Ness. And behind them yet again, it will be down to Justin Hollins, a midseason pickup last year from the Rams, and Brenton Cox, a former Gator who went undrafted due to character concerns in spite of his pretty good tape. 

*Strength/Weakness?:* If Gary is back and healthy, which he seems to be given that he was activated from PUP, this could be a strength. Lukas Van Ness has flashed at camp and will get significant snaps spelling starters if he doesn't start. Preston Smith is a solid, dependable producer who will consistently get 5-8 sacks a year. But without Gary and Van Ness, this was a struggling unit last year, so mark this as a we'll see.

* IDL (5): Kenny Clark, TJ Slaton, Devonte Wyatt, Colby Wooden, Karl Brooks

*Training camp battles to watch:* The one here to watch will be whether TJ Slaton, the third-year man out of Florida, or last year’s first-round selection Devonte Wyatt, will serve as Kenny Clark’s primary running mate when rushing four. Slaton is a terrific run defender, while Wyatt has flashed as a pass rusher, so the expectation now is for them to get on the field when it suits their skillsets, but could either pull ahead to be the primary starter? Wyatt has been tearing up camp. The other battle to watch is if last year's seventh round pick, Jonathan Ford, makes the 53 man roster. LaFleur said he's had a great camp, but we haven't heard much.

*Strength/Weakness?:* If Devonte Wyatt is as good as advertised in camp, mark this as a strength. The Packers let a significant number of snaps walk out the door with Lowry and Reed departing, but their presence was a major factor in Wyatt not getting enough playing time last year. Kenny Clark is a fringe Pro Bowl talent every year who's the heart and soul of the Packers' run defense, and the rookies could have an opportunity to showcase their talents in obvious passing situations given their lighter weights and pass rushing acumen.

* LB (5): De’Vondre Campbell, Quay Walker, Isaiah McDuffie, Eric Wilson, Tariq Carpenter 

*Training camp battles to watch:* There's actually not a lot going on here. It's pretty clear what the pecking order will be, and the biggest off-season question at linebacker: whether Krys Barnes would return, was answered when the Packers didn't pick up his option. It’s clear the pecking order will go from Campbell, the one-time First Team All Pro, to Walker, who flashed in his rookie campaign, to McDuffie, who had a noticeable second-year jump in 2022, to Wilson, a special teams player for Bisaccia. One unanswered question here would be whether the Packers keep 4 or 5 linebackers, with 2022 seventh-round pick Tariq Carpenter, who competed at safety and was a special teams standout, competing for the fifth spot. 

*Strength/Weakness?:* Depends on if Campbell can prove that he can get back to his 2021 All-Pro form. He was supposedly hampered by injury throughout 2022, which led to inconsistent play, so hopefully a full offseason to heal will help. Walker was brilliant in pass coverage last year for an LB, even if his block shedding and tackling depth (how far down the field he gets to the runner) left something to be desired. 

* CB (6): Jaire Alexander, Eric Stokes, Rasul Douglas, Keisean Nixon, Carrington Valentine, Corey Ballentine

*Training camp battles to watch:* Keisean Nixon, a first-team All-Pro at kick returner last season, has said he intends to do the same at cornerback. He will potentially start the season in the slot with Jaire Alexander and Rasul Douglas outside while third-year corner Eric Stokes recovers from a season-ending foot and ankle injury in 2022. Once Stokes returns, it’s a question as to which two between him, Alexander and Douglas will play on the perimeter, and whether the loser of that battle will be able to displace Nixon in the slot. Stokes was terrific as a rookie but suffered an awful sophomore slump that saw him lose the latter half of his season to an injury at Ford Field in Week 9. Third-year safety Innis Gaines has also gotten playing time in the slot at camp. In addition, rookie seventh-round pick Carrington Valentine has been terrific at camp and made a play almost everyday; it will be hard to keep him off the field. Is it fair to expect him to be the primary backup if any of the outside corners go down?

*Strength/Weakness?:* Strength, especially on the boundary. Jaire Alexander is one of the best corners in football, and Rasul Douglas is still a ballhawk and competitor on the outside who can use his size and length to knock away passes. In the slot, there's a major question mark, as Douglas struggled there last year, and physically speaking, the player most suited to playing there would be Jaire, but you don't pay him $21M to be a slot corner primarily. 

* S (4): Darnell Savage, Rudy Ford, Jonathan Owens, Dallin Leavitt

*Training camp battles to watch:* Of these, Savage and Leavitt likely have their jobs secure, with Savage playing on his fully guaranteed fifth-year option, and Leavitt being a special teams ace. Ford also plays on special teams as a gunner, but between him, Owens and Moore, they only have $200,000 guaranteed combined among themselves. Will Brian Gutekunst keep five safeties? Any of them could be cut and it wouldn’t be a surprise. And don’t count out rookie Anthony Johnson Jr., a projected mid-round selection the Packers scooped up in the seventh round.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Weakness. Savage was damn near a liability in 2022, with seemingly half the big plays this secondary gave up resulting in a finger being pointed at or by him. And the selection of running mates opposite him isn't exactly inspiring either. Look to this, or OT, being the first pick of the draft by the Packers in 2024.

* ST (3): LS Matt Orzech, K Anders Carlson, P Pat O’Donnell

*Training camp battles to watch:* The Packers are likely going to keep Carlson, the brother of Raiders kicker Daniel Carlson. Pat O’Donnell, who was fine last year, faces a small challenge from all-XFL punter Daniel Whelan, while rookie Hunter … will try,, but likely fail, to challenge Super Bowl-winning long snapper Orzech, who received a 3-year contract from Green Bay.

*Strength/weakness?*: Orzech gives the Packers a dependable long snapper for the first time in nearly a decade, and O'Donnell was fine in 2022. Rookie Anders Carlson has had a rough start to camp, with good kicking strength but not a lot of accuracy. He's bounced back the last few days. Other than Carlson, and combining with the return/kicking protection units, expect Rich Bisaccia's special teams transformation program to continue having a major impact on the upward trend of this group.

# Schedule Predictions in Comments",t5_2qmg3,14808,2301,"2023 Offseason Review Series: Green Bay Packers# Coaching Changes

This offseason, the Packers allowed defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, whom Rasul Douglas credits with his turnaround from a practice squad castoff into a legit player, to walk to Atlanta, while they promoted safeties coach Ryan Downard to DB coach, and hiring Greg Williams from Arizona as their defensive passing game coordinator (no relation to Bountygate architect Gregg Williams). Rich Bisaccia was named assistant head coach in addition to his role as special teams coordinator, while outside linebackers coach Jason Rebrovich was promoted to pass rush specialist. They also hired some additional names (Tim Lester, senior analyst, Rob Grosso, offensive quality control, Kyle Wilber, special teams quality control).

## Projected 53-man, Training camp battles, Strengths and weaknesses

* QB (2): Jordan Love, Sean Clifford

*Training camp battles to watch:* It’s a fight between rookie Sean Clifford and USFL MVP Alex McGough, and Brian Gutekunst loves his draft picks. Last year, all eleven of his draft selections in April made his final 53 man roster, and expect Clifford to have a massive advantage coming in because of this, even if he were bad. Clifford has been good at camp though, and those who are watching have said he displays more zip on his throws than he did in college. Could it have been a coaching issue?

*Strength/Weakness?:* The lack of a vet backup is concerning, and it's fair to say that the Packers QB room is at least a huge question mark, if not a weakness. But in terms of matching the numbers of last year's performance, Jordan Love's job of being better than 2022 Aaron Rodgers (with a broken thumb) is not too difficult: Rodgers failed to hit 300 yards passing in any game last year.

* RB (3): Aaron Jones, AJ Dillon, Tyler Goodson

*Training camp battles to watch:* It will be interesting to see if any in a group that includes last year’s UDFA Tyler Goodson, returning vet Patrick Taylor, and seventh-round rookie Lew Nichols will be the third RB on the depth chart, if they make it at all. Brian Gutekunst kept just two on the initial 53 man roster last year. Nichols has missed some time with injuries during camp.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Fair to say Packers have one of, if not the, best running back tandem in football. Aaron Jones has been a dynamic playmaker every year he's been in Matt LaFleur's offense, and he's been pretty blessed with good health in that time. AJ Dillon is a thumping downhill runner, and he consistently gets a yard or two more than most backs would thanks to his size and strength. Expect Green Bay to lean into the run game, and lean into it a lot, to help out their young QB.

* WR (6): Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Samori Toure, Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks, Malik Heath

*Training camp battles to watch:* Packers coaches are raving about second-year pro Samori Toure, and it will be a question whether he or rookie Jayden Reed will get more snaps as the third receiver. On the other hand, it looks to be an uphill battle for rookie Grant DuBose to make the roster as he missed minicamp with injuries, all while undrafted free agent Malik Heath has impressed as he has run some reps with the first-team offense, something not even Wicks has managed to do.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Packers have the cheapest, youngest WR room in the NFL, with Christian Watson being the most seasoned vet here. Him and Doubs will need to make second-year leaps for this room to be considered a strength by any stretch of the imagination. 

* TE (4): Luke Musgrave, Josiah Deguara, Tucker Kraft, Tyler Davis

*Training camp battles to watch:* Will rookie Luke Musgrave immediately catapult to the top of the depth chart? Coaches and teammates have heaped praise onto just how fast and smooth he looks on the field. Or will third-year tight end Josiah Deguara, the most experienced pass catcher on the roster, start the season as TE1?

*Strength/Weakness?:* Just like the WR room, the TEs here are among the youngest in the NFL. TEs are also usually much more difficult to onboard than WRs, so look to some growing pains here as the rookies get their welcome to the NFL moments throughout the season.

* OL (9): David Bakhtiari, Yosh Nijman, Zach Tom, Caleb Jones, Jon Runyan Jr., Josh Myers, Elgton Jenkins, Royce Newman

*Training camp battles to watch:* Assuming Bakhtiari is healthy, it will be a fight between fifth-year former UDFA Yosh Nijman and second-year tackle Zach Tom to be the starter at right tackle. And if Nijman wins that fight, prepare to see the talented Tom, who played at every spot but center in his rookie year, to give third-year center Josh Myers a serious run for his money there. Bakhtiari, Jenkins and fourth-year guard Runyan all likely have their starting spots locked up, but there’s going to be a serious squeeze to be a backup interior lineman among third-year guard Royce Newman, second-year lineman Sean Rhyan, and fourth-year guard Jake Hanson, of which only two, maybe possibly just one, will make the roster.

*Strength/Weakness?:* When healthy, the left side of the line (with David Bakhtiari and Elgton Jenkins) is the best in football, and there's no question about it. And despite the struggles of center Josh Myers (in run blocking, primarily), expect the Packers offensive line to still be a strength overall, as they should give Jordan Love a comfortable time in the pocket if they can stay healthy. 

* EDGE (5): Rashan Gary, Preston Smith, Lukas Van Ness, Kingsley Enagbare, Brenton Cox Jr.

*Training camp battles to watch:* It's not a battle with a player, but Rashan Gary's timeline for his return from a season-ending ACL tear will determine the success of the Packers defense early on. He was activated from the PUP list yesterday. Preston Smith is likely solidified in his role as the number two pass rusher behind Gary, though behind him, it'll be a battle between second-year OLB Kingsley Enagbare and the rookie Lukas Van Ness. And behind them yet again, it will be down to Justin Hollins, a midseason pickup last year from the Rams, and Brenton Cox, a former Gator who went undrafted due to character concerns in spite of his pretty good tape. 

*Strength/Weakness?:* If Gary is back and healthy, which he seems to be given that he was activated from PUP, this could be a strength. Lukas Van Ness has flashed at camp and will get significant snaps spelling starters if he doesn't start. Preston Smith is a solid, dependable producer who will consistently get 5-8 sacks a year. But without Gary and Van Ness, this was a struggling unit last year, so mark this as a we'll see.

It's pretty clear what the pecking order will be, and the biggest off-season question at linebacker: whether Krys Barnes would return, was answered when the Packers didn't pick up his option. It’s clear the pecking order will go from Campbell, the one-time First Team All Pro, to Walker, who flashed in his rookie campaign, to McDuffie, who had a noticeable second-year jump in 2022, to Wilson, a special teams player for Bisaccia.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Depends on if Campbell can prove that he can get back to his 2021 All-Pro form.

* CB (6): Jaire Alexander, Eric Stokes, Rasul Douglas, Keisean Nixon, Carrington Valentine, Corey Ballentine

*Training camp battles to watch:* Keisean Nixon, a first-team All-Pro at kick returner last season, has said he intends to do the same at cornerback. He will potentially start the season in the slot with Jaire Alexander and Rasul Douglas outside while third-year corner Eric Stokes recovers from a season-ending foot and ankle injury in 2022.

"Brett Veach on potentially trading Chris Jones: “I think the best resolution would be for him to end his career as a Chief and get that financial security…hopefully, we get this resolved, but we have no intentions of making a trade.”",nfl,"&gt;“He’s a great player, and he wants a big contract,” Veach said. “He deserves a big contract, and I don’t think there’s any surprises in that regard. But there’s just some hurdles we have to work through in regards to how we can keep this thing going for the short- and long-term. But we’ve never wavered on, ‘This is a guy that we want to exhaust all of our efforts to get done,’ because that’s how much we think of him.”

&gt;Jones is due to make $19.5 million in 2023, the final year of his current contract. His contract comes with a non-waivable daily fine of $50,000. He reportedly wants $30 million per year.

&gt;Veach pointed out that last year’s trade of Tyreek Hill came in part from the recognition that, eventually, the team would have to address Jones’s contract.

&gt;“[W]hen we did make that move with Tyreek, one of the determining factors was because there was an expected Chris Jones deal,” Veach said. “And so, to do Tyreek, there was a concern of, ‘Would we be able to do Chris?’ “And so that was a moment of time, and it was before the draft, that we hit the reset button. And we’re like, ‘You know, it’s really hard to trade a player the magnitude of Tyreek Hill.’ But we’re following that up with someone just as significant and on the defensive side.”

&gt;“You reach this point where you, I think, both parties want to just kind of take a deep breath and reset a little bit,” Veach said. “And then [the talks] become less frequent, but at the same time, I mean, the start of the season is [September 8]. So by nature, they’re gonna have to heat up again. And like I said, that’s why we’re still optimistic.”

&gt;“Sometimes these things take some time,” Veach said. “So we’ll just continue to press away and work through that and hopefully make some movement here. We went into this, and as we’re having these ongoing dialogues, our intent and desire has always been to get Chris Jones secured for the foreseeable future, and we’re gonna press on with that mindset.”",t5_2qmg3,1995,355,"Brett Veach on potentially trading Chris Jones: “I think the best resolution would be for him to end his career as a Chief and get that financial security…hopefully, we get this resolved, but we have no intentions of making a trade.”&gt;“He’s a great player, and he wants a big contract,” Veach said. “He deserves a big contract, and I don’t think there’s any surprises in that regard.

The 2023 r/NFL Roast of The Buffalo Bills (8/32),nfl,"###WELCOME TO THE 2023 R/NFL ROAST OF THE BUFFALO BILLS

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

Players playing in the perfect era?,nfl," Which current players possess skills that are perfectly suited for the present era? I was reflecting on some exceptional players from past eras and pondering how they would fare in today's game. Some players might have been equally if not more successful in the current era (e.g. Deion Sanders, Steve Young, and Lawrence Taylor). Others probably would have needed to adapt to a different style of play (e.g. Mike Singletary).

This line of thought led me to consider the current era. There are undoubtedly great players today who might have thrived even more in a different era, like Derrick Henry. However, I believe that many present-day players wouldn't have performed nearly as well had they played 20-30 years ago. Among those, I consider Fred Warner as the player best suited to the modern era (though an argument could be made for Lamar Jackson).

[Effort Post] The NFL Top 100 is broken! A proposal for how to fix it!,nfl,"*Context: I am a statistician (with some experience in poll design), and I get needlessly annoyed about the NFL Top 100. As the list concluded today, here a (rather small) rant as well as possible solution.*

The issues around the voting for the NFL top 100 are well established. Even some former players like Pat McAfee [have spoken out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV2vfxZLgwc) about the fact that the voting procedure is not very well done. As a result the list heavily favours skill positions (QBs and WR alone make up 30 out of 100 players this year while there are only 8 linemen) and tends to feature established players past their prime over their younger counterparts. Even the NFLs own media team is [pointing some of this out](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-s-top-100-players-of-2023-five-things-the-voters-got-wrong).

For some context, [this](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/inside-the-top-100-voting-process) article by NBC sports explains the voting process: *""To vote, each player lists only his top 20 players in the league. The player listed at No. 1 gets 20 points, the player listed at No. 2 gets 19 points, and the process continues until the player listed at No. 20 gets one point.""*

The main issue with the current voting system is that it encourages tactical voting. Players vote for players on their team/position in an effort to boost their standing. This is very understandable: **If all players were to truthfully list their 20 best players, it would be unlikely that enough players even received votes to make a top 100 list.** To add to this issue only \~28% of the players actually vote (see nbc article above), so a players standing is likely highly impacted by how many of his teammates/players at his position voted. 

In my opinion, **a fairly easy way to fix this would be**:

* Each player gets 15 votes made up of:
   * 5 for players at his position (or position group?)
   * 5 for players on his team 
   * 5 players without any restrictions 
* Within each category, the first player gets 5 points, the second 4, etc. 
* Players can put the same player multiple times. e.g. A backup QB on the chiefs could put Patrick Mahomes as the No. 1 for all 3 categories

The score of each player would then be calculated as a **percentage of the total points that he could have gotten**. E.g. A cornerback on the Rams score would be: 

**\[total points\] / \[players that voted + players on the rams that voted + cornerbacks that voted\] / 5**

This new system would address a couple of issues:

* Players are less incentivised to vote for their teammates and position mates, as they have dedicated sections to do so
* Players get an outsized vote on players that they can actually evaluate (those that play their position, and those that they see at training)
* The list is no longer dependent on how many of a players teammates/position voted, as the score is calculated relative to that

In my opinion this process would result in a more fair but also more interesting list as it would likely feature players that few people outside the league have heard of. Then it would finally actually deserve its moniker: **""...as voted on by their peers.""**

2023 NFL Offseason Review Series: Philadelphia Eagles,nfl,"2022 Recap:

**Record**: 14-3, 1st in NFC East, Lost to KC in Super Bowl LVII. [32 Teams/32 Days recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/11svvbz/2023_32_teams32_days_philadelphia_eagles/?user_id=19180238&amp;web_redirect=true)

Coaching changes:

|Position|In|From|Out|To|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Offensive Coordinator|Brian Johnson|Eagles QB Coach|Shane Steichen|Colts HC|
|Defensive Coordinator|Sean Desai|Seahawks asst. HC/def. asst.|Jonathan Gannon|Cardinals HC|
|QB Coach|Alex Tanney|Eagles asst. QB coach|Brian Johnson|Eagles OC|
|LB Coach|D.J. Eliot|Temple DC/OLB coach|Nick Rallis|Cardinals DC|
|DB Coach|D.K. McDonald|Eagles asst. DB coach|Dennard Wilson|Ravens DB coach|

The Eagles were expected to have plenty of assistants in high demand after their Super Bowl run, and they ultimately lost OC Shane Steichen and DC Jonathan Gannon to head coaching gigs. (Although not many Eagles fans view the latter as a loss.) In response, Nick Sirianni made a concerted effort to maintain the continuity of 2022’s staff while bringing in plenty of outside names to lend experience and keep things fresh. An example of this continuity is the promotion of QB coach **Brian Johnson** to OC - Johnson has years of OC experience at the college level, and he and Hurts have a long history. An example of this commitment to new faces is the addition of **Sean Desai** as DC - while Vic Fangio was the dream, Desai is younger and should offer the flexibility and varied background that should cater to a new-look Eagles defense.

The Eagles also added multiple coaches that each carry with them decades of coaching experience, both at the pro and college levels. The most prominent name of these is senior defensive assistant **Matt Patricia**. Say what you will about his Lions tenure or his disastrous offensive playcalling in New England last year, but Patricia at least carries nearly 2 decades of NFL coaching experience, mostly as a defensive assistant under the best defensive head coach of this generation. Senior offensive assistant **Marcus Brady** also carries NFL playcalling experience with him; Brady was Sirianni’s replacement as Colts OC when Sirianni joined Philly. Defensive assistants **D.J. Eliot** and **Taver Johnson** each have multiple years of experience at the college level.

It was inevitable that the Eagles’ cap situation would mean the loss of multiple key players. And indeed, 5 of the Eagles’ top 8 defensive players by snaps played, along with their starting RB and RG, would all leave.

But rather than trying to chase big names through free agency or the trade market, the Eagles opted for a more cautious approach: finding players who were about to hit their prime, had a strong college/draft pedigree and/or some flashes of NFL talent, and may have been devalued because of injury concerns, and signing them to 1-year, low guarantee deals.  The big money they did throw around was used to re-sign key veterans.

The biggest free agency splurge was QB **Marcus Mariota**, for just 1 year at $5M. While this might seem curious to outsiders given the eventual Jalen Hurts extension, it’s not surprising to Eagles fans, who’ve seen the team put tremendous value on backup QB the past few years. (And given they won a Super Bowl with a backup QB, can you blame them?). The Eagles didn’t need major offensive improvements, but added some good lotto tickets in RBs **Rashaad Penny** and **D’Andre Swift** and WR **Olamide Zaccheaus**. Penny has flashed tremendous talent in Seattle but has been snakebitten by injury; a healthy year behind the Eagles’ OL could result in a big payday. The Eagles got Swift for cheap when he was crowded out of Detroit’s RB room; he’s flashed gamebreaking 3-down talent, but has struggled with injuries and consistency. Zaccheaus, a Philly local, adds some versatility and depth to a WR corps that struggled to produce outside of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.

On defense, the Eagles did well to retain CB James Bradberry and DT Fletcher Cox, but otherwise had to get creative to fill their defensive gaps while maintaining cap flexibility. The biggest plunge was ex-Steeler S **Terrell Edmunds**, who was certainly hurt by a cold safety market, but should be a favorite to start for a shallow S corps with his experience and versatility. DBs **Justin Evans** and **Greedy Williams** are both former 2nd rounders whose careers have been marred by injury, but are otherwise cheap gambles who could fill in as young-ish depth pieces. LB **Nicholas Morrow** was productive for Chicago in 2022 and is the most experienced LB the Eagles have, while DT **Kentavius Street** provides interior pass rushing depth.

It’s fair to say that free agency wasn’t exciting. The Eagles lost a lot of critical players and didn’t land any marquee names, nor did they bring in any guys who have consistently produced at a high level in the NFL (although I am personally bullish on Penny.) But this free agency was nonetheless a practical one. One of the reasons why they struggled after Super Bowl LII was an over-dependence on signing older free agents to multi-year contracts; when they declined and/or got hurt, they ended up being albatrosses. But the Eagles went in a different direction this offseason; not only did they largely target younger free agents, but they targeted players with good draft pedigrees, who with a bounceback year and better injury luck could turn into real contributors as they enter their prime. Furthermore, by offering lower guarantees, the Eagle will at least ensure they remain flexible roster-wise and cap-wise in case some don’t pan out, which could prove handy if the Eagles angle for a big trade down the line. Plus, thanks to their diversified approach, they should receive the maximum 4 compensatory picks for 2024.

**Free agency Yelp Review:** 3.5 stars.

**Draft recap**

|Pick (Round-OVR)|Player|
|:-|:-|
|1-9|Jalen Carter, DT, Georgia|
|1-30|Nolan Smith, LB, Georgia|
|3-66|Tyler Steen, OL, Alabama|
|3-67|Sydney Brown, S, Illinois|
|4-105|Kelee Ringo, CB, Georgia|
|6-188|Tanner McKee, QB, Stanford|
|7-249|Moro Ojomo, DT, Texas|

Continuing a draft trend that the Eagles largely followed in 2021 and 2022, the team focused on finding players at premium positions with great measurables and plenty of experience at high-level NCAA programs.

Drafting DT **Jalen Carter** at 9th overall fits this theme to a tee: not only was he arguably the most disruptive player on Georgia’s elite defense over the last couple years, but given the high value the Eagles put on the trenches and the thinning out of the DT corps this offseason, Carter fits both need and organizational philosophy as well. Picking fellow Bulldog EDGE **Nolan Smith** at 30 is yet another example of this approach: a Georgia Bulldog with outstanding testing who should fit well in the Eagles’ pass rushing rotation with his explosiveness.

The Eagles added OL **Tyler Steen** and S **Sydney Brown** with back-to-back 3rd round picks; both come from excellent college programs (in Brown’s case, a college that has produced many high-level DB prospects the last few years), have plenty of college experience, excellent athletic traits (apart from Steen’s arm length and Brown’s height) and the versatility that could translate well to the NFL.

What could have been a quiet Day 3 to the draft was anything but, as the Eagles moved quickly to get back into the 4th round to take CB **Kelee Ringo**, yet another toolsy athlete with high-end college experience (the Eagles’ 3rd Georgia Bulldog of the draft) and ballhawk skills, and who was rated by the consensus a couple rounds higher than his actual draft slot. QB **Tanner McKee** has prototypical size, a solid arm, and experience in a pro-style offense; even if he’s not a perfect analog of Jalen Hurts, he could still be a solid product of the QB factory. DT **Moro Ojomo** has the frame and athleticism to develop into a rotational interior rusher. Oh, and adding D’Andre Swift for pennies on the dollar gives an explosive offense another weapon.

**Draft Yelp Review:** 4.5 stars.

|Pos|1|2|3|4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|QB|**Jalen Hurts**|*Marcus Mariota*|*Tanner McKee*|Ian Book|

**Yelp review:** 4.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* It’s hard to improve on form that nearly won MVP, but if there’s anyone who’s up to the task, it’s Hurts. Mariota should be an improvement over Gardner Minshew if it comes to that, but hopefully it doesn’t!

**Position battle of note**: *Tanner McKee vs. Ian Book for QB3.* Book has the edge when it comes to NFL experience, athleticism, and mobility. McKee has the edge in size and the better arm. There’s not a lot at stake here, given that QB1 and QB2 are set, but it will make preseason a little more interesting. Hopefully it’s more compelling than Carson Strong vs. Reid Sinnett.

|RB|**D’Andre Swift**|*Rashaad Penny*|*Kenny Gainwell*|*Boston Scott*|Trey Sermon|Kennedy Brooks|

**Yelp rating:** 3.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Yes.* RB is the position group with the best chance to be more productive in 2023 than they were in 2022. That’s saying something given that Miles Sanders put up big numbers in his own right, but when healthy Swift and Penny both have the potential to be better. Even if neither achieves Miles’s numbers individually, the ground game should be even more dynamic.

**Position battle of note:** *D’Andre Swift vs. Rashaad Penny vs. Kenny Gainwell for RB1.* Emphasis on the former two - Swift is capable of playing 3 downs and Penny has a tremendous combo of size and speed. Gainwell has shown some playmaking ability in the limited reps he’s gotten, but he doesn’t have RB1 size and Swift is already a better receiver, so he’s more of a distant favorite.

|WR|**DeVonta Smith**|Deon Cain|Charleston Rambo|*Britain Covey*|
|Slot|**Quez Watkins**|*Olamide Zaccheaus*|Greg Ward|Jadon Haselwood|

**Yelp rating**: 4 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* The top 3 haven’t changed, and while Olamide Zaccheaus is a better receiver than Zach Pascal, he doesn’t provide the same all-around contribution that Pascal did. So any improvement is dependent on a bounceback from Quez Watkins or a breakthrough from one of the UDFAs.

**Position battle of note**: Quez Watkins vs. Olamide Zaccheaus for WR3. Quez has the size, speed, and incumbency advantage, and has a past track record of production in this offense. Zaccheaus is more versatile, can be more of a downfield threat, and had the more productive season last year, which is remarkable when you consider Atlanta’s hesitancy to pass.

|TE|**Dallas Goedert**|*Jack Stoll*|*Grant Calcaterra*|Dan Arnold|Tyree Jackson|Brady Russell|

**Yelp rating**: 4 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Maybe.* This answer depends on both the health of Dallas Goedert and the progression of Grant Calcaterra. If Goedert can play a full 17-game schedule, then yes. If Calcaterra can find some snaps as a productive backup, that’s an even bigger yes. But nothing is likely to change beyond that.

**Position battle of note**: Grant Calcaterra vs. Dan Arnold for backup receiving TE. Calcaterra’s 2022 camp was interrupted by a hamstring injury, and he never got in a rhythm on offense despite the Eagles giving him a part snap share. (Even the Goedert injury didn’t give him much of a boost.) Dan Arnold isn’t exactly daunting competition, but his floor could be higher than Calcaterra’s as a receiver. With Dallas Goedert and Jack Stoll firmly the top 2 TEs, this is the best shot either player has of getting onto the active roster.

**Yelp rating**: 4.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* It’s hard to improve from being the best, and they’ll have to replace RG, likely with someone without extensive NFL experience. If they can get solid play from their new RG, plus more consistent play from Landon Dickerson and Jordan Mailata, plus continued All-Pro form from Lane Johnson and Jason Kelce, then they could surpass last year’s level. But that’s a tough needle to thread.

**Position battle of note**: Cam Jurgens vs. Tyler Steen vs. Jack Driscoll for RG. This is the first real starting OL position battle in a while, as the Mailata/Dillard LT battle in 2021 was a farce. Jurgens was drafted last year as Kelce’s heir apparent at C, and looked good in preseason; the main question is if he has the size to play anywhere but C, but on the Eagles’ website, Jurgens is listed at the same weight that Seumalo played at last year, and his arm length isn’t far off Seumalo’s either. Steen might have the most upside with his athleticism and size, but the Eagles don’t prefer to start rookies on the OL; furthermore, Steen doesn’t have experience on the interior and the Eagles may prefer him to be more of a utility player who can play at LT. Driscoll doesn’t get much mention as a prospective starter, but he does at least have the highest floor if neither of the other two shines in camp. (Although I think he’s a much longer shot than the other two, as the Eagles value him as a utility reserve.)

**Yelp rating**: 3.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *No.* Javon Hargrave is a major loss, and even if Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh didn’t offer much more than veteran depth, they were still instrumental in the Eagles’ Super Bowl run. We could certainly see Jordan Davis begin to realize his massive potential this year in a new scheme that uses more of his NT skills. And Jalen Carter could be the real deal from Week 1. And one of the young reserve DTs like Milton Williams, Marlon Tulipulotu, or Moro Ojomo could take a big step forward. But that’s asking a lot.

**Position battle of note**: Milton Williams vs. Kentavius Street vs. Moro Ojomo et al. for backup 3-technique DT. Jordan Davis will likely handle the starting NT role, and Carter and Fletcher Cox will likely rotate in alongside him, with the two playing together in passing situations. But beyond that, there's a lot of rotational snaps available. Williams has incredible athletic potential - his pre-draft testing was comparable to Aaron Donald’s - but hasn’t found more than a part role as an interior rusher and has yet to show the size needed to play every down. Street can rush the passer, but offers little as a run stopper. Ojomo could be the best run stopper of the lot, but he’s a rookie and ideally needs to add weight. (I mentioned Marlon Tulipulotu before, but he’s more of a run-stopping NT like Davis, albeit smaller.)

|SLB|**Haason Reddick**|*Nolan Smith*|*Patrick Johnson*|Kyron Johnson||

**Yelp rating**: 5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* Again, improving from being the best is hard. Haason Reddick and Josh Sweat are bona fide pass rushers in their prime, and if the Eagles can manage Brandon Graham’s snaps again, he should remain highly efficient, even if another double digit sack season is unlikely. Any improvement is mainly dependent on how quickly Nolan Smith makes an impact. Robert Quinn looked like great EDGE depth on paper last year when he was acquired, but was a disappointment; if Smith can make plays on sheer burst and football instincts while developing his pass rushing repertoire, he’ll be an upgrade on Quinn, and this could be the scariest position group in the NFL.

**Position battle of note**: *Nolan Smith vs. Patrick Johnson vs. Kyron Johnson for backup SAM.* There’s no disputing that Haason Reddick will dominate snaps here. Patrick Johnson is the incumbent after winning the backup role with a strong 2022 camp, but he managed just 7 pressures on 213 defensive snaps and has 0 sacks in 2 years, although he’s become a core special teamer. Smith has the edge in athleticism, pedigree, and ceiling, but still faces a learning curve in the NFL possibly amplified by his size. Kyron Johnson lost the backup SAM battle to Patrick Johnson in 2022; like Nolan Smith, he’s an undersized EDGE with great athleticism, but doesn’t have the high-end college experience that Smith had and is even more undersized than Smith.

**Will they be better than last year?** *No.* T.J. Edwards and Kyzir White were solid every-down players; Edwards was a constant playmaker while White was rock steady in coverage. Even if you’re optimistic about Dean being an impact player this year (which he looked like in limited snaps) there’s still plenty of questions about who will start along side him - and who will play behind him.

**Position battle of note**: *I dunno, basically all of them?* Apart from Dean, the depth chart is wide open. Morrow is the favorite to start alongside Dean thanks to his experience. Elliss burst onto the scene with an impressive 9 tackles in garbage time reps in his first 2 NFL games, but is more suited for special teams at this point. Bradley is a core special teamer who has rarely seen defensive action since being picked in 2020. Taylor made 6 starts in 2021 and has incredible athleticism, but he didn’t even make the active roster in 2022 and might never be able to process NFL speed. VanSumeren is an undrafted rookie.

**Yelp rating**: 4.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not*. That’s partly a testament to how good Darius Slay, James Bradberry, and Avonte Maddox were last year. But Darius Slay is 32 and James Bradberry is 30, so there’s a risk of them hitting a wall (which Slay did for a chunk of the latter half of 2022), and none of the CBs behind these 2 are proven on the outside at the NFL level. Any hope in a step up comes from better injury luck for Maddox (who missed 8 games in 2022) and any of the other CBs on the roster stepping up.

**Position battle of note**: *Any roster slots past the top 4 CBs*. Slay, Bradberry, and Maddox are the locked-in starters, and Zech McPhearson has been a key special teamer with outside CB potential who has gotten some slot looks in OTAs. Beyond that, it’s going to be a dogfight for backup spots. The incumbents are Josh Jobe (backup outside and special teamer) and Josiah Scott (backup slot CB and occasional deep safety) but Kelee Ringo should fit in somewhere as a developmental player, and Greedy Williams should both have a chance to compete, and there are a slew of 2022 and 2023 UDFAs ready for a fight.

**Yelp rating**: 3 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* CJGJ was a dynamic playmaker who will be tough to replace. And even if Epps was unremarkable, he wasn’t necessarily someone who hurt a defense. Terrell Edmunds has good experience, Blankenship showed some flashes as a rookie, and Brown has tremendous athleticism, so it’s not like they couldn’t put together a decent safety corps with that. Plus, with such a strong CB tandem, at least some of the pressure will be taken off them. It’s just that it’s hard to project them having the collective impact Epps and CJGJ provided.

**Position battle of note**: *Terrell Edmunds vs. Reed Blankenship vs. Sydney Brown for starting S roles.* Edmunds's 75 starts are nearly triple the total of the rest of the S corps, and he's a former 1st rounder who can play in a variety of positions, but he didn't get any big bonus, so he's not a stone cold lock to start. Blankenship looked good when he filled in for CJGJ during the season, and has plenty of college experience, a knack for the ball, and good all-around athleticism, but it's unknown how much his aggressiveness will hurt him once teams have more tape on him. Brown is a tremendous athlete and was highly productive at Illinois, but his length could be an issue.

**Yelp rating**: 3.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Maybe.* The 2022 Eagles’ special teams were simply bad before turning things around in the second half of the year. In a way, some credit needs to be given to STs coordinator Michael Clay, as the Eagles haven’t added special teams specialists (e.g. Chris Maragos or Bryan Braman) in a long time, relying on young defensive reserves to learn the scheme, so getting even average special teams performances is a plus. If they can play like they did in the latter half of last year, they’ll be in a much better position. There’s little concern about Jake Elliott; the low number of FGs he attempted was due to the aggressiveness and efficiency of the offense, not a lack of trust in his leg. And punting can hopefully only get better.

**Position battle of note**: Arryn Siposs vs. Ty Zentner for starting P. Yes, it’s the most notable position battle because it’s the only position battle, but it’s at least of interest for Eagles fans. Siposs has been a below-average punter in his first 2 NFL seasons.

Coaching changes:

|Offensive Coordinator|Brian Johnson|Eagles QB Coach|Shane Steichen|Colts HC|
|Defensive Coordinator|Sean Desai|Seahawks asst. HC/def. asst.|Jonathan Gannon|Cardinals HC|

|LB Coach|D.J. Eliot|Temple DC/OLB coach|Nick Rallis|Cardinals DC|
|DB Coach|D.K. McDonald|Eagles asst. DB coach|Dennard Wilson|Ravens DB coach|

The Eagles were expected to have plenty of assistants in high demand after their Super Bowl run, and they ultimately lost OC Shane Steichen and DC Jonathan Gannon to head coaching gigs. (Although not many Eagles fans view the latter as a loss.) In response, Nick Sirianni made a concerted effort to maintain the continuity of 2022’s staff while bringing in plenty of outside names to lend experience and keep things fresh. An example of this continuity is the promotion of QB coach **Brian Johnson** to OC - Johnson has years of OC experience at the college level, and he and Hurts have a long history. An example of this commitment to new faces is the addition of **Sean Desai** as DC - while Vic Fangio was the dream, Desai is younger and should offer the flexibility and varied background that should cater to a new-look Eagles defense.

The Eagles also added multiple coaches that each carry with them decades of coaching experience, both at the pro and college levels. The most prominent name of these is senior defensive assistant **Matt Patricia**. Say what you will about his Lions tenure or his disastrous offensive playcalling in New England last year, but Patricia at least carries nearly 2 decades of NFL coaching experience, mostly as a defensive assistant under the best defensive head coach of this generation. Senior offensive assistant **Marcus Brady** also carries NFL playcalling experience with him; Brady was Sirianni’s replacement as Colts OC when Sirianni joined Philly. Defensive assistants **D.J. Eliot** and **Taver Johnson** each have multiple years of experience at the college level.

It was inevitable that the Eagles’ cap situation would mean the loss of multiple key players. And indeed, 5 of the Eagles’ top 8 defensive players by snaps played, along with their starting RB and RG, would all leave.

But rather than trying to chase big names through free agency or the trade market, the Eagles opted for a more cautious approach: finding players who were about to hit their prime, had a strong college/draft pedigree and/or some flashes of NFL talent, and may have been devalued because of injury concerns, and signing them to 1-year, low guarantee deals.  The big money they did throw around was used to re-sign key veterans.

The biggest free agency splurge was QB **Marcus Mariota**, for just 1 year at $5M. While this might seem curious to outsiders given the eventual Jalen Hurts extension, it’s not surprising to Eagles fans, who’ve seen the team put tremendous value on backup QB the past few years. (And given they won a Super Bowl with a backup QB, can you blame them?). The Eagles didn’t need major offensive improvements, but added some good lotto tickets in RBs **Rashaad Penny** and **D’Andre Swift** and WR **Olamide Zaccheaus**. Penny has flashed tremendous talent in Seattle but has been snakebitten by injury; a healthy year behind the Eagles’ OL could result in a big payday. The Eagles got Swift for cheap when he was crowded out of Detroit’s RB room; he’s flashed gamebreaking 3-down talent, but has struggled with injuries and consistency. Zaccheaus, a Philly local, adds some versatility and depth to a WR corps that struggled to produce outside of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.

On defense, the Eagles did well to retain CB James Bradberry and DT Fletcher Cox, but otherwise had to get creative to fill their defensive gaps while maintaining cap flexibility. The biggest plunge was ex-Steeler S **Terrell Edmunds**, who was certainly hurt by a cold safety market, but should be a favorite to start for a shallow S corps with his experience and versatility. DBs **Justin Evans** and **Greedy Williams** are both former 2nd rounders whose careers have been marred by injury, but are otherwise cheap gambles who could fill in as young-ish depth pieces. LB **Nicholas Morrow** was productive for Chicago in 2022 and is the most experienced LB the Eagles have, while DT **Kentavius Street** provides interior pass rushing depth.

It’s fair to say that free agency wasn’t exciting. The Eagles lost a lot of critical players and didn’t land any marquee names, nor did they bring in any guys who have consistently produced at a high level in the NFL (although I am personally bullish on Penny.) But this free agency was nonetheless a practical one. One of the reasons why they struggled after Super Bowl LII was an over-dependence on signing older free agents to multi-year contracts; when they declined and/or got hurt, they ended up being albatrosses. But the Eagles went in a different direction this offseason; not only did they largely target younger free agents, but they targeted players with good draft pedigrees, who with a bounceback year and better injury luck could turn into real contributors as they enter their prime. Furthermore, by offering lower guarantees, the Eagle will at least ensure they remain flexible roster-wise and cap-wise in case some don’t pan out, which could prove handy if the Eagles angle for a big trade down the line. Plus, thanks to their diversified approach, they should receive the maximum 4 compensatory picks for 2024.

**Draft recap**

|Pick (Round-OVR)|Player|
|:-|:-|
|1-9|Jalen Carter, DT, Georgia|
|1-30|Nolan Smith, LB, Georgia|
|3-66|Tyler Steen, OL, Alabama|

|4-105|Kelee Ringo, CB, Georgia|
|6-188|Tanner McKee, QB, Stanford|
|7-249|Moro Ojomo, DT, Texas|

Continuing a draft trend that the Eagles largely followed in 2021 and 2022, the team focused on finding players at premium positions with great measurables and plenty of experience at high-level NCAA programs.

Drafting DT **Jalen Carter** at 9th overall fits this theme to a tee: not only was he arguably the most disruptive player on Georgia’s elite defense over the last couple years, but given the high value the Eagles put on the trenches and the thinning out of the DT corps this offseason, Carter fits both need and organizational philosophy as well. Picking fellow Bulldog EDGE **Nolan Smith** at 30 is yet another example of this approach: a Georgia Bulldog with outstanding testing who should fit well in the Eagles’ pass rushing rotation with his explosiveness.

The Eagles added OL **Tyler Steen** and S **Sydney Brown** with back-to-back 3rd round picks; both come from excellent college programs (in Brown’s case, a college that has produced many high-level DB prospects the last few years), have plenty of college experience, excellent athletic traits (apart from Steen’s arm length and Brown’s height) and the versatility that could translate well to the NFL.

What could have been a quiet Day 3 to the draft was anything but, as the Eagles moved quickly to get back into the 4th round to take CB **Kelee Ringo**, yet another toolsy athlete with high-end college experience (the Eagles’ 3rd Georgia Bulldog of the draft) and ballhawk skills, and who was rated by the consensus a couple rounds higher than his actual draft slot. QB **Tanner McKee** has prototypical size, a solid arm, and experience in a pro-style offense; even if he’s not a perfect analog of Jalen Hurts, he could still be a solid product of the QB factory. DT **Moro Ojomo** has the frame and athleticism to develop into a rotational interior rusher. Oh, and adding D’Andre Swift for pennies on the dollar gives an explosive offense another weapon.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Yes.* RB is the position group with the best chance to be more productive in 2023 than they were in 2022. That’s saying something given that Miles Sanders put up big numbers in his own right, but when healthy Swift and Penny both have the potential to be better. Even if neither achieves Miles’s numbers individually, the ground game should be even more dynamic.

**Position battle of note:** *D’Andre Swift vs. Rashaad Penny vs. Kenny Gainwell for RB1.* Emphasis on the former two - Swift is capable of playing 3 downs and Penny has a tremendous combo of size and speed. Gainwell has shown some playmaking ability in the limited reps he’s gotten, but he doesn’t have RB1 size and Swift is already a better receiver, so he’s more of a distant favorite.

**Position battle of note**: Quez Watkins vs. Olamide Zaccheaus for WR3. Quez has the size, speed, and incumbency advantage, and has a past track record of production in this offense. Zaccheaus is more versatile, can be more of a downfield threat, and had the more productive season last year, which is remarkable when you consider Atlanta’s hesitancy to pass.

If Goedert can play a full 17-game schedule, then yes. If Calcaterra can find some snaps as a productive backup, that’s an even bigger yes. But nothing is likely to change beyond that.

**Position battle of note**: Grant Calcaterra vs. Dan Arnold for backup receiving TE. Calcaterra’s 2022 camp was interrupted by a hamstring injury, and he never got in a rhythm on offense despite the Eagles giving him a part snap share. (Even the Goedert injury didn’t give him much of a boost.) Dan Arnold isn’t exactly daunting competition, but his floor could be higher than Calcaterra’s as a receiver. With Dallas Goedert and Jack Stoll firmly the top 2 TEs, this is the best shot either player has of getting onto the active roster.

But that’s a tough needle to thread.

**Position battle of note**: Cam Jurgens vs. Tyler Steen vs. Jack Driscoll for RG. This is the first real starting OL position battle in a while, as the Mailata/Dillard LT battle in 2021 was a farce. Jurgens was drafted last year as Kelce’s heir apparent at C, and looked good in preseason; the main question is if he has the size to play anywhere but C, but on the Eagles’ website, Jurgens is listed at the same weight that Seumalo played at last year, and his arm length isn’t far off Seumalo’s either. Steen might have the most upside with his athleticism and size, but the Eagles don’t prefer to start rookies on the OL; furthermore, Steen doesn’t have experience on the interior and the Eagles may prefer him to be more of a utility player who can play at LT. Driscoll doesn’t get much mention as a prospective starter, but he does at least have the highest floor if neither of the other two shines in camp. (Although I think he’s a much longer shot than the other two, as the Eagles value him as a utility reserve.)

And one of the young reserve DTs like Milton Williams, Marlon Tulipulotu, or Moro Ojomo could take a big step forward. But that’s asking a lot.

**Position battle of note**: Milton Williams vs. Kentavius Street vs. Moro Ojomo et al. for backup 3-technique DT. Jordan Davis will likely handle the starting NT role, and Carter and Fletcher Cox will likely rotate in alongside him, with the two playing together in passing situations. But beyond that, there's a lot of rotational snaps available. Williams has incredible athletic potential - his pre-draft testing was comparable to Aaron Donald’s - but hasn’t found more than a part role as an interior rusher and has yet to show the size needed to play every down. Street can rush the passer, but offers little as a run stopper. Ojomo could be the best run stopper of the lot, but he’s a rookie and ideally needs to add weight. (I mentioned Marlon Tulipulotu before, but he’s more of a run-stopping NT like Davis, albeit smaller.)

Any improvement is mainly dependent on how quickly Nolan Smith makes an impact. Robert Quinn looked like great EDGE depth on paper last year when he was acquired, but was a disappointment; if Smith can make plays on sheer burst and football instincts while developing his pass rushing repertoire, he’ll be an upgrade on Quinn, and this could be the scariest position group in the NFL.

**Position battle of note**: *Nolan Smith vs. Patrick Johnson vs. Kyron Johnson for backup SAM.* There’s no disputing that Haason Reddick will dominate snaps here. Patrick Johnson is the incumbent after winning the backup role with a strong 2022 camp, but he managed just 7 pressures on 213 defensive snaps and has 0 sacks in 2 years, although he’s become a core special teamer. Smith has the edge in athleticism, pedigree, and ceiling, but still faces a learning curve in the NFL possibly amplified by his size. Kyron Johnson lost the backup SAM battle to Patrick Johnson in 2022; like Nolan Smith, he’s an undersized EDGE with great athleticism, but doesn’t have the high-end college experience that Smith had and is even more undersized than Smith.

|MLB|**Nakobe Dean**|*Shaun Bradley*|*Davion Taylor*|
|WLB|**Nicholas Morrow**|*Christian Elliss*|Ben VanSumeren|

**Yelp rating:** 2 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *No.* T.J. Edwards and Kyzir White were solid every-down players; Edwards was a constant playmaker while White was rock steady in coverage. Even if you’re optimistic about Dean being an impact player this year (which he looked like in limited snaps) there’s still plenty of questions about who will start along side him - and who will play behind him.

**Position battle of note**: *I dunno, basically all of them?* Apart from Dean, the depth chart is wide open. Morrow is the favorite to start alongside Dean thanks to his experience. Elliss burst onto the scene with an impressive 9 tackles in garbage time reps in his first 2 NFL games, but is more suited for special teams at this point. Bradley is a core special teamer who has rarely seen defensive action since being picked in 2020. Taylor made 6 starts in 2021 and has incredible athleticism, but he didn’t even make the active roster in 2022 and might never be able to process NFL speed. VanSumeren is an undrafted rookie.

|CB|**James Bradberry**|*Kelee Ringo*|Mario Goodrich|Eli Ricks|
|Slot|**Avonte Maddox**|*Zech McPhearson*|Josiah Scott||

**Yelp rating**: 4.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not*. That’s partly a testament to how good Darius Slay, James Bradberry, and Avonte Maddox were last year. But Darius Slay is 32 and James Bradberry is 30, so there’s a risk of them hitting a wall (which Slay did for a chunk of the latter half of 2022), and none of the CBs behind these 2 are proven on the outside at the NFL level. Any hope in a step up comes from better injury luck for Maddox (who missed 8 games in 2022) and any of the other CBs on the roster stepping up.

**Position battle of note**: *Any roster slots past the top 4 CBs*. Slay, Bradberry, and Maddox are the locked-in starters, and Zech McPhearson has been a key special teamer with outside CB potential who has gotten some slot looks in OTAs. Beyond that, it’s going to be a dogfight for backup spots. The incumbents are Josh Jobe (backup outside and special teamer) and Josiah Scott (backup slot CB and occasional deep safety) but Kelee Ringo should fit in somewhere as a developmental player, and Greedy Williams should both have a chance to compete, and there are a slew of 2022 and 2023 UDFAs ready for a fight.

|SS|**Terrell Edmunds**|*Sydney Brown*|*K’Von Wallace*|
|FS|**Reed Blankenship**|*Justin Evans*|Tristin McCollum|

**Yelp rating**: 3 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* CJGJ was a dynamic playmaker who will be tough to replace. And even if Epps was unremarkable, he wasn’t necessarily someone who hurt a defense. Terrell Edmunds has good experience, Blankenship showed some flashes as a rookie, and Brown has tremendous athleticism, so it’s not like they couldn’t put together a decent safety corps with that. Plus, with such a strong CB tandem, at least some of the pressure will be taken off them. It’s just that it’s hard to project them having the collective impact Epps and CJGJ provided.

**Position battle of note**: *Terrell Edmunds vs. Reed Blankenship vs. Sydney Brown for starting S roles.* Edmunds's 75 starts are nearly triple the total of the rest of the S corps, and he's a former 1st rounder who can play in a variety of positions, but he didn't get any big bonus, so he's not a stone cold lock to start. Blankenship looked good when he filled in for CJGJ during the season, and has plenty of college experience, a knack for the ball, and good all-around athleticism, but it's unknown how much his aggressiveness will hurt him once teams have more tape on him. Brown is a tremendous athlete and was highly productive at Illinois, but his length could be an issue.

|P|*Arryn Siposs*|Ty Zentner||
|LS|*Rick Lovato*|||
|PR|*Britain Covey*|*DeVonta Smith*||
|KR|*Boston Scott*|*Britain Covey*|*Quez Watkins*|

**Yelp rating**: 3.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Maybe.* The 2022 Eagles’ special teams were simply bad before turning things around in the second half of the year. In a way, some credit needs to be given to STs coordinator Michael Clay, as the Eagles haven’t added special teams specialists (e.g. Chris Maragos or Bryan Braman) in a long time, relying on young defensive reserves to learn the scheme, so getting even average special teams performances is a plus. If they can play like they did in the latter half of last year, they’ll be in a much better position. There’s little concern about Jake Elliott; the low number of FGs he attempted was due to the aggressiveness and efficiency of the offense, not a lack of trust in his leg. And punting can hopefully only get better.

**Position battle of note**: Arryn Siposs vs. Ty Zentner for starting P. Yes, it’s the most notable position battle because it’s the only position battle, but it’s at least of interest for Eagles fans. Siposs has been a below-average punter in his first 2 NFL seasons. Zentner flashed a strong leg in college, but faces similar concerns over consistency."

# Coaching Changes:

**Leslie Frazier (Defensive Coordinator/Assistant Head Coach) departure:**

The biggest coaching move of the offseason came when the Bills announced that Leslie Frazier, the defensive coordinator for that past five (5) seasons, was ""stepping back from football"" for the upcoming season. After the announcement was made, Brandon Beane (Bills GM) and co. spoke in a manner consistent with this verbiage that implied the move was Frazier's and not a team-forced decision. However, since his resignation Frazier has been reported to have visited with other teams within the league. Therefore it's fair to speculate whether the decision was entirely Frazier's to leave his post. One way or another the time had come for a change at the helm of this Bills defense. During his tenure as the Bills DC, Frazier led ""elite"" regular season defenses that were ultimately paper tigers against the league's better offensive units. There's no better evidence to this point than the last three Bills playoff exits in which Frazier's defenses have allowed an **average of** **36 points and 468 yards** in those games, one of which was the infamous 13 seconds debacle. In short, it was time for Frazier to go. His defensive philosophy of ""bend but don't break"", the lack of aggressiveness from the defensive front, and the utilization of prevent defense all really held back some otherwise talented Bills teams. With that being said, his leadership within the building and his years of experience will be missed by the organization.

**Sean McDermott new defensive play caller:**

Head Coach Sean McDermott has assumed the role of defensive play caller for the Bills' 23-24 season. He last called plays as the DC for the Carolina Panthers from 2011-2017, which includes the Panthers 2015 Super Bowl run. When you factor in McDermott's defensive background and the need at DC he  was the obvious choice to replace Frazier, especially considering the awkward timing of Frazier's departure. The news of Frazier's departure broke on February 28 which was well into the coaching carousel. (For perspective, the 'Niners hired former Panthers interim HC Steve Wilks as their new DC on February 7, and the Miami Dolphins hired Vic Fangio on February 15). At this point in the offseason most if not all of the established DC's that had been available were scooped up, and so the Bills either had to choose from within or search the remainder of the market. They chose the former and went with their head coach. There are two questions whose answers will prove to be the most vital to the success or failure of his unit in 2023:

1. How well does he function as both the head coach and the defensive play caller?

First and foremost, this will be McDermott's first season as *both* head coach and defensive coordinator. How well does he balance both roles, and can he be an effective head coach as well as an effective defensive coordinator? McDermott as a head coach has many strengths but one of his weaknesses is game management, which doesn't become easier when you add play calling to his game day responsibilities. This is where the Bills coaching staff that they have built around McDermott will benefit him greatly. For the game management component Marc Lubick is on staff as the Bills game management coach. For the defensive responsibilities the Bills have several coaches in the room who have functioned as defensive coordinators in the league (e.g. Al Holcomb, Eric Washington), so he has strong support in handling those duties as well. If McDermott is going to succeed as the Bills defensive coordinator he appears to have the personal talent, past experience, and necessary support to do so.

2. How much of the defense in past seasons was McDermott responsible for?

We don't know how much of the recent defensive failures were McDermott's fault. Leslie Frazier may have been the defensive coordinator, but McDermott is a veteran DC in the league and head coach of this team, so it's fair to assume he had input into defensive scheming and game planning. Also, during this offseason there's been a report that McDermott took over play calling during the 13 seconds debacle. We may never know if that's true or not, but this season will at least tell us how much of McDermott's influence has permeated this defense in the recent seasons. If the defense shows the same inconsistencies and lapses that it did in 2022, then it's fair to be concerned about whether or not a McDermott-led defense can bring a Super Bowl to Buffalo.

**Eric Washington promoted to Assistant Head Coach/Defensive Line Coach:**

Washington has been the Bills defensive line coach since 2020 and has served as a senior defensive assistant. Washington will now assume Frazier's former role of assistant head coach. Washington coached alongside McDermott in Carolina from 2011-2017, and following McDermott's departure Washington took over as defensive coordinator for the Panthers. Washington and McDermott's time on task and familiarity together should aid in his transition to assistant head coach. Also, as previously stated Washington has time as an NFL DC which should aid coach McDermott in his transition to play calling.

**Jim Salgado (safeties coach) fired:**

The first staff change of the offseason came only days after the bludgeoning at the hands of the Bengals, as it was announced that Salgado had been relieved of his position as safeties coach. Salgado had been with the Bills since McDermott's arrival in Buffalo in 2017. This one's a bit of a head scratcher. Salgado served as the team's nickel coach for the 2021/2022 campaign where Taron Johnson really broke out as a premier slot CB. During the 2022 offseason he was transitioned from nickel coach to the safeties coach. The 2022 season saw the top three safeties on the team experience significant injuries which really hurt the position group, then only days after the playoff ousting he was let go from the team. It's hard to blame him for the pitfalls of his position group within the context of the season, but clearly the team saw fit to make the change.

**Joe Danna (safeties coach) hired:**

Danna has been a defensive backs coach in the league since 2008 and most recently served as the Houston Texans safeties coach in 2022.

**Al Holcomb hired as senior defensive assistant:**

Al Holcomb joins the Bills defensive coaching staff after spending the last three seasons with the Carolina Panthers as their defensive run game coordinator. He also had a brief stint as the interim defensive coordinator in the 2022 season after the firing of Panthers head coach Matt Rhule and defensive coordinator Phil Snow. As with Washington, Holcomb coached alongside Sean McDermott in Carolina when Holcomb was the linebackers coach there from 2013-2017. Holcomb's resume includes coaching the elite linebacker tandem of Thomas Davis and Luke Keuchly. With the team in limbo at the linebacker position (more on that later), Holcomb will surely bring invaluable coaching to a position group that arguably will need the most coaching of the 2023 Bills roster.

**Chad Hall (wide receivers coach) departure**:

Chad Hall joined the Bills as an offensive assistant with the new regime in 2017, and in 2019 assumed the role of wide receivers coach. Hall was highly respected within the organization and a well-liked member of the coaching staff. His contract expired at the end of 2022/2023 and he signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the same role. There hasn't been a lot of information available on the circumstances surrounding Hall's departure. Regardless, losing Hall was a big loss within the building, not only because of the length of his tenure but also the respect and admiration he commanded from the players.

**Adam Henry hired as new wide receivers coach:**

Henry joins the Bills after most recently coaching at the University of Indiana as a co-offensive coordinator and receivers coach. He also has multiple stops in the NFL as WR coach, serving tenures with San Francisco, NY Giants, Cleveland Browns, and the Dallas Cowboys. In joining the Bills, Henry will be tasked with getting the most out of guys who to this point have mostly been supporting cast in the league.

Most notable FA losses:

**Tremaine Edmunds** **(LB)** \- Edmunds was drafted in the first round of the 2018 NFL draft at pick 16 overall and was Brandon Beane's second ever draft pick as GM of the Buffalo Bills (the first was none other than Josh Allen). Edmunds entered the league as a young athletic phenom with unlimited upside and has been the Bills starting MLB ever since. The Bills exercised his fifth year option for 2022 and a contract extension never materialized. Edmunds proceeded to have arguably the best season of his career in 2022 and in free agency signed a four year, $72M contract with the Chicago Bears. Edmunds has been the most polarizing player among Bills fans in recent memory, as Bills fans are deeply divided on his performance and necessity to this team. The critics of Edmunds have been frustrated by his lack of consistency in run fits and block shedding in the run game. For a player with ""elite physical traits"" he seemingly is incapable of shedding blocks and gets swallowed at the line of scrimmage far too often. Also, there have been multiple instances of Edmunds initiating contact close to the line of scrimmage and subsequently getting dragged by the running back for additional yards. But it is possible that this lack of consistency is explained by two truths about the Bills defense. First, the Bills defense runs predominantly through a nickel base, so Edmunds has routinely operated as just one of two linebackers on the field, playing in a light box even on running downs. Second, the defensive line in front of Edmunds has never been stellar. In fact one of the most glaring weaknesses that this team has had over the course of his time in Buffalo has been a lack of a quality defensive line in front of him. The strength of Edmunds game, on the other hand, is his effectiveness in the passing game; he uses his 6'5"" frame and 83"" wingspan to severely limit what opposing quarterbacks are able to accomplish in the middle of the field, and his 80.4 passer rating allowed against his coverage in 2022 supports that. Consequently the Bills have overall been a very good team against opposing tight ends during his time in Buffalo. Edmunds would have been a quality free agent signing for Buffalo if he could have been had for a reasonable salary. He offers multiple qualities that will be difficult to replace, most notably his availability (he only missed six games in five seasons) and leadership. Ultimately Edmunds went out and got paid, and the Bills are left searching for the new answer at MLB. Without signing Edmunds, Brandon Beane has allocated cap space to other position groups and he is hedging that McDermott will get similar production from the defense while utilizing a different option at MLB.

&amp;#x200B;

**Devin Singletary (RB) -** Devin Singletary signed a one year $3.75M contract with the Houston Texans this offseason after his rookie contract with the Bills expired. Singletary leaves the Bills after being the team's leading rusher over the past four seasons, posting a respectable 4.7 yards per carry over that time. The Bills need more from their running game though and ultimately Singletary does not offer a skillset that can do that. He's an average to below-average athlete who's skillset is more fitting of a complimentary RB2 rather than the premier running back in one of the league's best offenses. The Bills drafted James Cook in the second round of last year's draft and it would appear that the RB1 role is his to lose.

&amp;#x200B;

**Isaiah McKenzie (WR)** \- McKenzie's five year run with the Bills ended in March one year into a two year contract he signed last offseason. McKenzie replaced Cole Beasley heading into the 2022 season as the team's primary slot option at wide receiver and he caught 42 of 65 targets for 423 yards and 4 touchdowns. McKenzie had displayed flashes of brilliance in limited opportunities in the years prior, and so the hope among Bills fans was that McKenzie would provide at least comparable production to what they got out of Beasley. The experiment ultimately did not work out, and in fact the Bills were so desperate for quality slot play that they signed Beasley out of retirement in an attempt to provide a spark for the Bills asynchronous offense. The Bills now move forward with 2022 fifth round receiver Khalil Shakir penciled in as WR3 on the depth chart.

Most notable FA signings:

**Jordan Poyer (S) -** Jordan Poyer has been among the league's best strong safeties for quite some time now, and he is part of an elite safety tandem with his running mate Micah Hyde. When the season ended and Poyer became an unrestricted free agent much of Bills Mafia did not expect to see the veteran safety re-sign with the Bills due to the contract he was reported to be after and the Bills lack of cap space. Poyer tested the market and ended up re-signing with the Bills on a two year deal for $12.5M. Poyer has led the Bills in interceptions in four of his six seasons as a member of the defense, and he brings exceptional coverage skills and physicality to the unit. He's vital to the operation of this defense; it's no coincidence that the Bills were undefeated during the regular season in 2022 when he was in the lineup. Bringing back Poyer was the most important signing of the offseason, especially considering the turnover at MLB and DC.

**Poona Ford (DT)** \- After signing on with the Bills this offseason Ford admitted he passed over more lucrative offers to join this unit, and this is a unit that will gladly welcome his talents to the middle of their defensive line. The Bills entered 2022 with Daquan Jones, Tim Settle, Jordan Phillips, and Ed Oliver as their primary defensive tackles. Ed Oliver continued to show flashes of the athletic disruptive pass rusher that earned him a top 10 overall pick, but far too often he was completely neutralized by the opposing OL and inconsistency continues to plague him. Daquan Jones was the Bills best defensive lineman and didn't miss a single game during the regular season but missed the Bengals playoff matchup. Tim Settle spent most of the season battling injury but was a disappointment in his first year with the Bills. And as always Jordan Phillips couldn't stay healthy to be part of the lineup to contribute in a meaningful fashion. Ford should be able to come in at NT as a day one starter and either absorb double teams to free up Oliver or create disruption in the pocket himself. This is arguably the Bills second most important signing of the offseason.

**Leonard Floyd (OLB)** \- When you look at the last three Bills postseason losses, one of the common themes among those games was inability to generate pressure on the quarterback. Both Mahomes and Burrow enjoyed comfortable pockets to throw from while the Bills defensive line failed to generate meaningful pressure to influence the game. Well this offseason Beane has taken another stab at attempting to correct this deficiency. Floyd comes to the Bills on a one year contract after posting three consecutive seasons with at least nine sacks, including one year which ended in a Super Bowl victory. Beane and co. hope that Floyd brings his Super Bowl pedigree to Buffalo to not only generate pressure with this unit, but also to help bridge the gap between the start of the season and when Von Miller returns to form in his recovery from a torn ACL.

**Connor McGovern (OG)** \- The Bills continue to throw resources at their defensive and offensive lines in hopes to finally get the right personnel in place. The offensive line is better than it was in that 2020 beatdown by the Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game, but it still has not been up to snuff over these past two seasons. Dion Dawkins (LT) and Mitch Morse (C) consistently perform at exceptional levels for their respective positions, but have dealt with a carousel of ineptitude around them at the other positions on the line. The likes of Roger Saffold, Jon Feliciano, Ike Boettger, and Cody Ford have all started for this unit and failed to perform at a level worthy of protecting franchise quarterback Josh Allen. Insert Connor McGovern, an athletic offensive lineman who has quietly improved every season in the league and become a quality NFL guard. McGovern most likely inserts into the LG spot in this line and seeks to anchor a position that hasn't been anchored in front of Allen during any of his tenure in Buffalo.

# 2023 Draft

&amp;#x200B;

**Pick 1.25 (25) Dalton Kincaid**

The Bills made Kincaid the first tight end taken in the 2023 draft when they leapfrogged the Dallas Cowboys to select him at pick 25 overall. Following the selection Brandon Beane said he ""had a good feeling Dallas would take him"" which prompted the exchange of their first and fourth round picks with the Jacksonville Jaguars to move up two spots to grab him.  Beane describes him as ""Cole Beasley in a different body type"" and specifically referenced Kincaid's elite hands as reasons they love this player. The need for this pick was clear: Josh Allen's limited receiving options after Stefon Diggs hamstrung the offense throughout the season. In the Bills week nine loss to the Jets, Diggs tallied five catches for 93 yards and zero touchdowns. The second leading receiver on the team that day was Gabe Davis who caught two passes for 33 yards. Fast forward to Bills vs. Bengals in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. While the Bengals were absolutely teeing off on the Bills secondary with their elite receiving group of Chase-Higgins-Boyd, Dawson Knox led the Bills in receiving yards on five catches for 65 yards, with rookie Khalil Shakir coming in second on the day with two catches for 40 yards. The point is, if this offense is going to perform at a championship level they needed at least one more talented pass catcher in the room. While tight end is typically a slow developing position in the NFL (e.g. Knox didn't see his breakout season until year three), Kincaid's time to maturity within the offense could be shortened based on the fact that he's going to be playing more of a receiver role in the offense as opposed to the traditional in-line tight end. Therefore, ideally he integrates into the offense quicker and by the end of year one becomes an impact playmaker. Look for Kincaid to be deployed as part of 12 personnel packages and in multiple alignments to maximize mismatches with the defense in both the run and pass attacks.

**Pick 2.28 (59) O'Cyrus Torrence**

O'Cyrus Torrence went from a projected day one draft pick to being selected at the end of the second round by the Buffalo Bills. One of the speculated reasons for this fall is a concerning medical evaluation due to his size, being listed at 6'5"" and 330 pounds. But Torrence has a heart warming background story of using football as motivation to lose weight, and so he has a factor that the Bills have shown to highly covet since Beane and McDermott have taken over; they love players who have had to fight to overcome adversity. If Torrence plays to the potential he flashed in 2022 at Florida, then their investment into this young man will have more than paid off. In 2022 Torrence earned first team AP All-American and first team All-SEC accolades for his performance protecting eventual first round draft pick Anthony Richardson. Perhaps the most impressive feat of this campaign though was his handling of Jalen Carter in Florida's matchup versus the Georgia Bulldogs. Not many players can say they neutralized Carter, but Torrence handled him that day and put a stamp of authenticity on his pedigree as one of college football's elite guard prospects of the 2023 draft. Torrence is a mauler of a guard who brings toughness and physicality to an offensive line desperately needing those qualities. In 2023 Torrence will be competing with proven veterans Connor McGovern, Ryan Bates, Ike Boettger, and David Edwards for a starting guard spot in the Bills offensive line. Should he beat out these veterans and earn a starting spot on Kromer's unit, look for him to be an immediate impact starter.

**Pick 3.28 (91) Dorian Williams**

From the moment Tremaine Edmunds signed with the Chicago Bears, Bills fans have anxiously awaited a move at linebacker to provide some clarity at the position. Veteran linebackers signed elsewhere in free agency and the Bills entered the draft with middle linebacker as the team's most glaring remaining need. At the end of day two Beane finally made a move and drafted Tulane's Dorian Williams with the team's third round pick. Williams, listed at 6'1"" and 228 pounds with a 33 3/4"" arm length, is an above-average athlete with a knack for tackling. Williams was a three year starter at Tulane at the middle linebacker position, leading the AAC in tackles in 2020 and winning defensive MVP of the 2022 Cotton Bowl against USC following a 17 tackle performance. Despite his stellar tackling ability, he is below average size for his position and struggles with handling blocks. In pass coverage Williams has displayed sufficient coverage abilities that could bolster his appeal as the day one starter for the Bills defense. After the draft the Bills staff indicated that he would start off working behind veteran Matt Milano as an off-ball linebacker, but since then all indications are that he is in the mix to compete for the starting middle linebacker job. Williams will at least contribute to the 2023 Buffalo Bills as a special teams player, but don't write him off as an option to see meaningful minutes at MLB this season as the defense tries to find the long-term replacement for Tremaine Edmunds.

**Pick 5.15 (150) Justin Shorter**

Justin Shorter is a sure-handed, big-bodied receiver whose physical measurements and skillset are primarily geared towards being a deep jump ball threat. In 2022 Shorter caught 29 of 51 passes for 577 yards and 2 touchdowns with a 0% drop rate. 351 of his 577 receiving yards (61%) were from deep balls and his yards per catch averaged 19.9 yards. His best chance at making the active roster will be to make quick gains in his route running ability as well as proving himself a reliable deep option for Josh Allen. However, his athletic limitations may prove too difficult to overcome for his chances as a vertical threat in the NFL, as his 4.55 second 40 time at the NFL combine reinforces the questions regarding his ability to win vertical routes with speed. Shorter is currently penciled in as WR6 on the Bills depth chart and will be a fringe player come roster cutdown day. Should he make the roster his most likely utilization will be a limited role with most of the season spent as a healthy scratch on game days.

**Pick 7.13 (230) Nick Broeker**

Nick Broeker was a three season starter at Ole Miss, playing 13 games at left guard and 23 games at left tackle. Broeker didn't miss a single game due to injury during his time at Ole Miss and was named second team All-SEC for his 2022 performance in which he allowed zero sacks on 435 pass blocking reps. Brandon Beane is always looking for quality talent in the trenches, so it's not surprise that he took the swing on an offensive line talent who projected to be taken earlier than the seventh round. Broeker's most likely path to the active roster is through injuries in training camp and the preseason, but he at least comes to camp with the opportunity to compete for a spot on the practice squad.

**Pick 7.35 (252) Alex Austin**

Alex Austin played four years at Oregon State and was a full time starter for the last two of those. He is a versatile cornerback who is able to play in both man and zone coverage schemes and offers average athleticism for his position. Austin joins a crowded CB room and is a long shot to make the Bills active roster, but could be a candidate to be signed to the practice squad.

Division: AFC East

Postseason: Lost in divisional round to Bengals

# Coaching Changes:

**Leslie Frazier (Defensive Coordinator/Assistant Head Coach) departure:**

The biggest coaching move of the offseason came when the Bills announced that Leslie Frazier, the defensive coordinator for that past five (5) seasons, was ""stepping back from football"" for the upcoming season. After the announcement was made, Brandon Beane (Bills GM) and co. spoke in a manner consistent with this verbiage that implied the move was Frazier's and not a team-forced decision. However, since his resignation Frazier has been reported to have visited with other teams within the league. Therefore it's fair to speculate whether the decision was entirely Frazier's to leave his post. One way or another the time had come for a change at the helm of this Bills defense. During his tenure as the Bills DC, Frazier led ""elite"" regular season defenses that were ultimately paper tigers against the league's better offensive units. There's no better evidence to this point than the last three Bills playoff exits in which Frazier's defenses have allowed an **average of** **36 points and 468 yards** in those games, one of which was the infamous 13 seconds debacle. In short, it was time for Frazier to go. His defensive philosophy of ""bend but don't break"", the lack of aggressiveness from the defensive front, and the utilization of prevent defense all really held back some otherwise talented Bills teams. With that being said, his leadership within the building and his years of experience will be missed by the organization.

**Sean McDermott new defensive play caller:**

Head Coach Sean McDermott has assumed the role of defensive play caller for the Bills' 23-24 season. He last called plays as the DC for the Carolina Panthers from 2011-2017, which includes the Panthers 2015 Super Bowl run. When you factor in McDermott's defensive background and the need at DC he  was the obvious choice to replace Frazier, especially considering the awkward timing of Frazier's departure. The news of Frazier's departure broke on February 28 which was well into the coaching carousel. (For perspective, the 'Niners hired former Panthers interim HC Steve Wilks as their new DC on February 7, and the Miami Dolphins hired Vic Fangio on February 15). At this point in the offseason most if not all of the established DC's that had been available were scooped up, and so the Bills either had to choose from within or search the remainder of the market. They chose the former and went with their head coach. There are two questions whose answers will prove to be the most vital to the success or failure of his unit in 2023:

1. How well does he function as both the head coach and the defensive play caller?

First and foremost, this will be McDermott's first season as *both* head coach and defensive coordinator. How well does he balance both roles, and can he be an effective head coach as well as an effective defensive coordinator? McDermott as a head coach has many strengths but one of his weaknesses is game management, which doesn't become easier when you add play calling to his game day responsibilities. This is where the Bills coaching staff that they have built around McDermott will benefit him greatly. For the game management component Marc Lubick is on staff as the Bills game management coach. For the defensive responsibilities the Bills have several coaches in the room who have functioned as defensive coordinators in the league (e.g. Al Holcomb, Eric Washington), so he has strong support in handling those duties as well. If McDermott is going to succeed as the Bills defensive coordinator he appears to have the personal talent, past experience, and necessary support to do so.

2. How much of the defense in past seasons was McDermott responsible for?

We don't know how much of the recent defensive failures were McDermott's fault. Leslie Frazier may have been the defensive coordinator, but McDermott is a veteran DC in the league and head coach of this team, so it's fair to assume he had input into defensive scheming and game planning. Also, during this offseason there's been a report that McDermott took over play calling during the 13 seconds debacle. We may never know if that's true or not, but this season will at least tell us how much of McDermott's influence has permeated this defense in the recent seasons. If the defense shows the same inconsistencies and lapses that it did in 2022, then it's fair to be concerned about whether or not a McDermott-led defense can bring a Super Bowl to Buffalo.

**Eric Washington promoted to Assistant Head Coach/Defensive Line Coach:**

Washington has been the Bills defensive line coach since 2020 and has served as a senior defensive assistant. Washington will now assume Frazier's former role of assistant head coach. Washington coached alongside McDermott in Carolina from 2011-2017, and following McDermott's departure Washington took over as defensive coordinator for the Panthers. Washington and McDermott's time on task and familiarity together should aid in his transition to assistant head coach. Also, as previously stated Washington has time as an NFL DC which should aid coach McDermott in his transition to play calling.

**Jim Salgado (safeties coach) fired:**

The first staff change of the offseason came only days after the bludgeoning at the hands of the Bengals, as it was announced that Salgado had been relieved of his position as safeties coach. Salgado had been with the Bills since McDermott's arrival in Buffalo in 2017. This one's a bit of a head scratcher. Salgado served as the team's nickel coach for the 2021/2022 campaign where Taron Johnson really broke out as a premier slot CB. During the 2022 offseason he was transitioned from nickel coach to the safeties coach. The 2022 season saw the top three safeties on the team experience significant injuries which really hurt the position group, then only days after the playoff ousting he was let go from the team. It's hard to blame him for the pitfalls of his position group within the context of the season, but clearly the team saw fit to make the change.

**Joe Danna (safeties coach) hired:**

Danna has been a defensive backs coach in the league since 2008 and most recently served as the Houston Texans safeties coach in 2022.

**Al Holcomb hired as senior defensive assistant:**

Al Holcomb joins the Bills defensive coaching staff after spending the last three seasons with the Carolina Panthers as their defensive run game coordinator. He also had a brief stint as the interim defensive coordinator in the 2022 season after the firing of Panthers head coach Matt Rhule and defensive coordinator Phil Snow. As with Washington, Holcomb coached alongside Sean McDermott in Carolina when Holcomb was the linebackers coach there from 2013-2017. Holcomb's resume includes coaching the elite linebacker tandem of Thomas Davis and Luke Keuchly. With the team in limbo at the linebacker position (more on that later), Holcomb will surely bring invaluable coaching to a position group that arguably will need the most coaching of the 2023 Bills roster.

**Chad Hall (wide receivers coach) departure**:

Chad Hall joined the Bills as an offensive assistant with the new regime in 2017, and in 2019 assumed the role of wide receivers coach. Hall was highly respected within the organization and a well-liked member of the coaching staff. His contract expired at the end of 2022/2023 and he signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the same role. There hasn't been a lot of information available on the circumstances surrounding Hall's departure. Regardless, losing Hall was a big loss within the building, not only because of the length of his tenure but also the respect and admiration he commanded from the players.

**Adam Henry hired as new wide receivers coach:**

Henry joins the Bills after most recently coaching at the University of Indiana as a co-offensive coordinator and receivers coach. He also has multiple stops in the NFL as WR coach, serving tenures with San Francisco, NY Giants, Cleveland Browns, and the Dallas Cowboys. In joining the Bills, Henry will be tasked with getting the most out of guys who to this point have mostly been supporting cast in the league.

|Tremaine Edmunds|MLB|Chicago Bears|
|Jaquan Johnson|S|Las Vegas Raiders|

Most notable FA losses:

**Tremaine Edmunds** **(LB)** \- Edmunds was drafted in the first round of the 2018 NFL draft at pick 16 overall and was Brandon Beane's second ever draft pick as GM of the Buffalo Bills (the first was none other than Josh Allen). Edmunds entered the league as a young athletic phenom with unlimited upside and has been the Bills starting MLB ever since. The Bills exercised his fifth year option for 2022 and a contract extension never materialized. Edmunds proceeded to have arguably the best season of his career in 2022 and in free agency signed a four year, $72M contract with the Chicago Bears. Edmunds has been the most polarizing player among Bills fans in recent memory, as Bills fans are deeply divided on his performance and necessity to this team. The critics of Edmunds have been frustrated by his lack of consistency in run fits and block shedding in the run game. For a player with ""elite physical traits"" he seemingly is incapable of shedding blocks and gets swallowed at the line of scrimmage far too often. Also, there have been multiple instances of Edmunds initiating contact close to the line of scrimmage and subsequently getting dragged by the running back for additional yards. But it is possible that this lack of consistency is explained by two truths about the Bills defense. First, the Bills defense runs predominantly through a nickel base, so Edmunds has routinely operated as just one of two linebackers on the field, playing in a light box even on running downs. Second, the defensive line in front of Edmunds has never been stellar. In fact one of the most glaring weaknesses that this team has had over the course of his time in Buffalo has been a lack of a quality defensive line in front of him. The strength of Edmunds game, on the other hand, is his effectiveness in the passing game; he uses his 6'5"" frame and 83"" wingspan to severely limit what opposing quarterbacks are able to accomplish in the middle of the field, and his 80.4 passer rating allowed against his coverage in 2022 supports that. Consequently the Bills have overall been a very good team against opposing tight ends during his time in Buffalo. Edmunds would have been a quality free agent signing for Buffalo if he could have been had for a reasonable salary. He offers multiple qualities that will be difficult to replace, most notably his availability (he only missed six games in five seasons) and leadership. Ultimately Edmunds went out and got paid, and the Bills are left searching for the new answer at MLB. Without signing Edmunds, Brandon Beane has allocated cap space to other position groups and he is hedging that McDermott will get similar production from the defense while utilizing a different option at MLB.

&amp;#x200B;

**Devin Singletary (RB) -** Devin Singletary signed a one year $3.75M contract with the Houston Texans this offseason after his rookie contract with the Bills expired. Singletary leaves the Bills after being the team's leading rusher over the past four seasons, posting a respectable 4.7 yards per carry over that time. The Bills need more from their running game though and ultimately Singletary does not offer a skillset that can do that. He's an average to below-average athlete who's skillset is more fitting of a complimentary RB2 rather than the premier running back in one of the league's best offenses. The Bills drafted James Cook in the second round of last year's draft and it would appear that the RB1 role is his to lose.

&amp;#x200B;

**Isaiah McKenzie (WR)** \- McKenzie's five year run with the Bills ended in March one year into a two year contract he signed last offseason. McKenzie replaced Cole Beasley heading into the 2022 season as the team's primary slot option at wide receiver and he caught 42 of 65 targets for 423 yards and 4 touchdowns. McKenzie had displayed flashes of brilliance in limited opportunities in the years prior, and so the hope among Bills fans was that McKenzie would provide at least comparable production to what they got out of Beasley. The experiment ultimately did not work out, and in fact the Bills were so desperate for quality slot play that they signed Beasley out of retirement in an attempt to provide a spark for the Bills asynchronous offense. The Bills now move forward with 2022 fifth round receiver Khalil Shakir penciled in as WR3 on the depth chart.

Most notable FA signings:

**Jordan Poyer (S) -** Jordan Poyer has been among the league's best strong safeties for quite some time now, and he is part of an elite safety tandem with his running mate Micah Hyde. When the season ended and Poyer became an unrestricted free agent much of Bills Mafia did not expect to see the veteran safety re-sign with the Bills due to the contract he was reported to be after and the Bills lack of cap space. Poyer tested the market and ended up re-signing with the Bills on a two year deal for $12.5M. Poyer has led the Bills in interceptions in four of his six seasons as a member of the defense, and he brings exceptional coverage skills and physicality to the unit. He's vital to the operation of this defense; it's no coincidence that the Bills were undefeated during the regular season in 2022 when he was in the lineup. Bringing back Poyer was the most important signing of the offseason, especially considering the turnover at MLB and DC.

**Poona Ford (DT)** \- After signing on with the Bills this offseason Ford admitted he passed over more lucrative offers to join this unit, and this is a unit that will gladly welcome his talents to the middle of their defensive line. The Bills entered 2022 with Daquan Jones, Tim Settle, Jordan Phillips, and Ed Oliver as their primary defensive tackles. Ed Oliver continued to show flashes of the athletic disruptive pass rusher that earned him a top 10 overall pick, but far too often he was completely neutralized by the opposing OL and inconsistency continues to plague him. Daquan Jones was the Bills best defensive lineman and didn't miss a single game during the regular season but missed the Bengals playoff matchup. Tim Settle spent most of the season battling injury but was a disappointment in his first year with the Bills. And as always Jordan Phillips couldn't stay healthy to be part of the lineup to contribute in a meaningful fashion. Ford should be able to come in at NT as a day one starter and either absorb double teams to free up Oliver or create disruption in the pocket himself. This is arguably the Bills second most important signing of the offseason.

**Leonard Floyd (OLB)** \- When you look at the last three Bills postseason losses, one of the common themes among those games was inability to generate pressure on the quarterback. Both Mahomes and Burrow enjoyed comfortable pockets to throw from while the Bills defensive line failed to generate meaningful pressure to influence the game. Well this offseason Beane has taken another stab at attempting to correct this deficiency. Floyd comes to the Bills on a one year contract after posting three consecutive seasons with at least nine sacks, including one year which ended in a Super Bowl victory. Beane and co. hope that Floyd brings his Super Bowl pedigree to Buffalo to not only generate pressure with this unit, but also to help bridge the gap between the start of the season and when Von Miller returns to form in his recovery from a torn ACL.

**Connor McGovern (OG)** \- The Bills continue to throw resources at their defensive and offensive lines in hopes to finally get the right personnel in place. The offensive line is better than it was in that 2020 beatdown by the Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game, but it still has not been up to snuff over these past two seasons. Dion Dawkins (LT) and Mitch Morse (C) consistently perform at exceptional levels for their respective positions, but have dealt with a carousel of ineptitude around them at the other positions on the line. The likes of Roger Saffold, Jon Feliciano, Ike Boettger, and Cody Ford have all started for this unit and failed to perform at a level worthy of protecting franchise quarterback Josh Allen. Insert Connor McGovern, an athletic offensive lineman who has quietly improved every season in the league and become a quality NFL guard. McGovern most likely inserts into the LG spot in this line and seeks to anchor a position that hasn't been anchored in front of Allen during any of his tenure in Buffalo.

**Pick 1.25 (25) Dalton Kincaid**

The Bills made Kincaid the first tight end taken in the 2023 draft when they leapfrogged the Dallas Cowboys to select him at pick 25 overall. Following the selection Brandon Beane said he ""had a good feeling Dallas would take him"" which prompted the exchange of their first and fourth round picks with the Jacksonville Jaguars to move up two spots to grab him.  Beane describes him as ""Cole Beasley in a different body type"" and specifically referenced Kincaid's elite hands as reasons they love this player. The need for this pick was clear: Josh Allen's limited receiving options after Stefon Diggs hamstrung the offense throughout the season. In the Bills week nine loss to the Jets, Diggs tallied five catches for 93 yards and zero touchdowns. The second leading receiver on the team that day was Gabe Davis who caught two passes for 33 yards. Fast forward to Bills vs. Bengals in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. While the Bengals were absolutely teeing off on the Bills secondary with their elite receiving group of Chase-Higgins-Boyd, Dawson Knox led the Bills in receiving yards on five catches for 65 yards, with rookie Khalil Shakir coming in second on the day with two catches for 40 yards. The point is, if this offense is going to perform at a championship level they needed at least one more talented pass catcher in the room. While tight end is typically a slow developing position in the NFL (e.g. Knox didn't see his breakout season until year three), Kincaid's time to maturity within the offense could be shortened based on the fact that he's going to be playing more of a receiver role in the offense as opposed to the traditional in-line tight end. Therefore, ideally he integrates into the offense quicker and by the end of year one becomes an impact playmaker. Look for Kincaid to be deployed as part of 12 personnel packages and in multiple alignments to maximize mismatches with the defense in both the run and pass attacks.

**Pick 2.28 (59) O'Cyrus Torrence**

O'Cyrus Torrence went from a projected day one draft pick to being selected at the end of the second round by the Buffalo Bills. One of the speculated reasons for this fall is a concerning medical evaluation due to his size, being listed at 6'5"" and 330 pounds. But Torrence has a heart warming background story of using football as motivation to lose weight, and so he has a factor that the Bills have shown to highly covet since Beane and McDermott have taken over; they love players who have had to fight to overcome adversity. If Torrence plays to the potential he flashed in 2022 at Florida, then their investment into this young man will have more than paid off. In 2022 Torrence earned first team AP All-American and first team All-SEC accolades for his performance protecting eventual first round draft pick Anthony Richardson. Perhaps the most impressive feat of this campaign though was his handling of Jalen Carter in Florida's matchup versus the Georgia Bulldogs. Not many players can say they neutralized Carter, but Torrence handled him that day and put a stamp of authenticity on his pedigree as one of college football's elite guard prospects of the 2023 draft. Torrence is a mauler of a guard who brings toughness and physicality to an offensive line desperately needing those qualities. In 2023 Torrence will be competing with proven veterans Connor McGovern, Ryan Bates, Ike Boettger, and David Edwards for a starting guard spot in the Bills offensive line. Should he beat out these veterans and earn a starting spot on Kromer's unit, look for him to be an immediate impact starter.

**Pick 3.28 (91) Dorian Williams**

From the moment Tremaine Edmunds signed with the Chicago Bears, Bills fans have anxiously awaited a move at linebacker to provide some clarity at the position. Veteran linebackers signed elsewhere in free agency and the Bills entered the draft with middle linebacker as the team's most glaring remaining need. At the end of day two Beane finally made a move and drafted Tulane's Dorian Williams with the team's third round pick. Williams, listed at 6'1"" and 228 pounds with a 33 3/4"" arm length, is an above-average athlete with a knack for tackling. Williams was a three year starter at Tulane at the middle linebacker position, leading the AAC in tackles in 2020 and winning defensive MVP of the 2022 Cotton Bowl against USC following a 17 tackle performance. Despite his stellar tackling ability, he is below average size for his position and struggles with handling blocks. In pass coverage Williams has displayed sufficient coverage abilities that could bolster his appeal as the day one starter for the Bills defense. After the draft the Bills staff indicated that he would start off working behind veteran Matt Milano as an off-ball linebacker, but since then all indications are that he is in the mix to compete for the starting middle linebacker job. Williams will at least contribute to the 2023 Buffalo Bills as a special teams player, but don't write him off as an option to see meaningful minutes at MLB this season as the defense tries to find the long-term replacement for Tremaine Edmunds.

**Pick 5.15 (150) Justin Shorter**

Justin Shorter is a sure-handed, big-bodied receiver whose physical measurements and skillset are primarily geared towards being a deep jump ball threat. In 2022 Shorter caught 29 of 51 passes for 577 yards and 2 touchdowns with a 0% drop rate. 351 of his 577 receiving yards (61%) were from deep balls and his yards per catch averaged 19.9 yards. His best chance at making the active roster will be to make quick gains in his route running ability as well as proving himself a reliable deep option for Josh Allen. However, his athletic limitations may prove too difficult to overcome for his chances as a vertical threat in the NFL, as his 4.55 second 40 time at the NFL combine reinforces the questions regarding his ability to win vertical routes with speed. Shorter is currently penciled in as WR6 on the Bills depth chart and will be a fringe player come roster cutdown day. Should he make the roster his most likely utilization will be a limited role with most of the season spent as a healthy scratch on game days.

**Pick 7.13 (230) Nick Broeker**

Nick Broeker was a three season starter at Ole Miss, playing 13 games at left guard and 23 games at left tackle. Broeker didn't miss a single game due to injury during his time at Ole Miss and was named second team All-SEC for his 2022 performance in which he allowed zero sacks on 435 pass blocking reps. Brandon Beane is always looking for quality talent in the trenches, so it's not surprise that he took the swing on an offensive line talent who projected to be taken earlier than the seventh round. Broeker's most likely path to the active roster is through injuries in training camp and the preseason, but he at least comes to camp with the opportunity to compete for a spot on the practice squad.

**Pick 7.35 (252) Alex Austin**

Alex Austin played four years at Oregon State and was a full time starter for the last two of those. He is a versatile cornerback who is able to play in both man and zone coverage schemes and offers average athleticism for his position. Austin joins a crowded CB room and is a long shot to make the Bills active roster, but could be a candidate to be signed to the practice squad.

NFL collusion on RB franchise tagging could be illegal: It's in the math,nfl,"RBs are 3 of 6 franchised players this year. Obviously, RBs are being tagged at a rate way, way beyond random. Since a franchise tag salary is based on the top 5 EXISTING salaries the invocation of the tag prevents the tagged players from increasing the tag amount. There's the rub. The NFL is preventing **ALL 3 of the top RB** from entering the market at fair market value. They have clearly suppressed the RB market through their mutual actions.  Each of the 3 franchising teams economically benefited from the other 2 teams. 

I'm not a lawyer and proving collusion in court is difficult, but this does hit the check boxes of conclusion.

Deshaun's 2022 doesn't meet any qualifiers. It wasn't a good season but he also had rust i'm sure.

Now it is fair to say that there have been some new blood with QBs. Allen was not good until 2020. Burrow and Herbert and Hurts became well known post 2020. 

So here is where Watson would rank in these categories for last season. This is meant to show where Watson stacks up to CURRENT guys if he returned to each level of play in his career

|2020|.22 (3rd)|20.2% (4th)|70.5 (3rd)|92.5 (3rd)|

This isn't including Watson's rushing value that some guys don't have.

The 2023 r/NFL Roast of The Los Angeles Rams (1/32),nfl,"Well folks, we are in the middle of the off-season yet again. Even as training camp rages on, the countdown towards regular season football can still feel like an eternity. Let's pass the time shall we?
So, to returning folks and newbies on their first rodeo…..

###WELCOME TO THE 2023 R/NFL ROAST OF THE LOS ANGELES RAMS

Let's have some fun.
-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,throwing on the one yard line,big ben rapist,one yard short), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Tennessee Titans**

There seems to be some revisionist history on Russell Wilson,nfl,"Saw a post asking ""what happened to Russell Wilson"" and saw a lot of comments giving the same tired narratives I've seen before. So I thought I'd chime in as someone who's watched every game of his career in Seattle.

I'll be straight up that I'm 100% a homer, but I won't say I thought Wilson was ever snubbed of MVP or anything like that. He was the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th best option many years, never quite #1. He was very consistent, but his absolute peak was short-lived (2018-early 2020).

Anyways heres the stats of his often overlooked early years. The time where people say he was carried by his defense and run game, when the truth is they were *all* very important pieces to the puzzle.

Russell Wilson's first 4 NFL seasons:

2012: **6th** in EPA/Play, **2nd** in PFF Grade, **3rd** in QBR, **4th** in Passer Rating

2013: **6th** in EPA/Play, **6th** in PFF Grade, **9th** in QBR, **7th** in Passer Rating

2014: **5th** in EPA/Play,  **14th** in PFF Grade, **6th** in QBR, **10th** in Passer Rating

2015: **3rd** in EPA/Play, **6th** in PFF Grade, **4th** in QBR, **1st** in Passer Rating

Edit: Updated his PFF grades. Thanks to DryDefenderRS for providing accurate ones which also include playoffs

**Both Super Bowl performances**:

2013

R. Wilson: **0.548 EPA/Play**  /  P. Manning: **-0.178 EPA/Play**

2014

R. Wilson: **0.237 EPA/Play**  /  T. Brady: **0.257 EPA/Play** (Wilson actually had a higher adjusted EPA/Play)

**From 2012 - 2015, including postseason, Wilson was 3rd in EPA/Play behind only Rodgers and Brady.**

Wilson's efficiency was among these names already in his first 4 years, AKA the years people say he was carried by an elite defense and run game.

He was also **1st** in completion percentage over expected during this time.

Yes the defense and run game were elite and he doesn't win that SB without them. No he wasn't ""carried"". Wilson did more than enough at the most important position.

After that we get into the years where the team lacked talent at many positions, yet the coaching staff and Wilson's play kept them in the playoff picture year after year.

Edit: I also remember a PFF tweet I saw a while back that listed the top graded QBs they've ever graded. I don't remember the exact order but it was essentially:

Brady, Rodgers, Manning, Brees, Mahomes, Wilson. That is ELITE company

So I thought I'd chime in as someone who's watched every game of his career in Seattle.

I'll be straight up that I'm 100% a homer, but I won't say I thought Wilson was ever snubbed of MVP or anything like that. He was the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th best option many years, never quite #1. He was very consistent, but his absolute peak was short-lived (2018-early 2020).

Anyways heres the stats of his often overlooked early years. The time where people say he was carried by his defense and run game, when the truth is they were *all* very important pieces to the puzzle.

Russell Wilson's first 4 NFL seasons:

2012: **6th** in EPA/Play, **2nd** in PFF Grade, **3rd** in QBR, **4th** in Passer Rating

2013: **6th** in EPA/Play, **6th** in PFF Grade, **9th** in QBR, **7th** in Passer Rating

2014: **5th** in EPA/Play,  **14th** in PFF Grade, **6th** in QBR, **10th** in Passer Rating

2015: **3rd** in EPA/Play, **6th** in PFF Grade, **4th** in QBR, **1st** in Passer Rating

Edit: Updated his PFF grades. Thanks to DryDefenderRS for providing accurate ones which also include playoffs

**Both Super Bowl performances**:

2013

R. Wilson: **0.548 EPA/Play**  /  P. Manning: **-0.178 EPA/Play**

2014

R. Wilson: **0.237 EPA/Play**  /  T. Brady: **0.257 EPA/Play** (Wilson actually had a higher adjusted EPA/Play)

**From 2012 - 2015, including postseason, Wilson was 3rd in EPA/Play behind only Rodgers and Brady.**

Wilson's efficiency was among these names already in his first 4 years, AKA the years people say he was carried by an elite defense and run game.

He was also **1st** in completion percentage over expected during this time.

Yes the defense and run game were elite and he doesn't win that SB without them. No he wasn't ""carried"". Wilson did more than enough at the most important position.

After that we get into the years where the team lacked talent at many positions, yet the coaching staff and Wilson's play kept them in the playoff picture year after year.

Edit: I also remember a PFF tweet I saw a while back that listed the top graded QBs they've ever graded. I don't remember the exact order but it was essentially:

Brady, Rodgers, Manning, Brees, Mahomes, Wilson. That is ELITE company

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week (Product + Restaurant) - Dallas Cowboys

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* HC Jonathan Gannon has set a new tone with the team
* QB Kyler Murray has no timetable for return
* S Budda Baker is all in after settling contract issue
* Signed Pat Elflein and Geoff Swaim

Overall it sounds like things are good with the team. HC Jonathan Gannon has zero tolerance for fights and has set his tone and made sure that is a part of it since coming here. We are back to folks saying it is day to day with QB Kyler Murray and it will be interested to watch and see how he progresses in his injury recovery. Huge win for the team that S Budda Baker after working through his contract issues is all in for the team. He is such a key piece for the team and will help them maintain a leader on the defensive side of the ball.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* Signed RB Godwin Igwebuike
* Overall QB Desmond Ridder has looked good thus far at camp
* Rookie RB BJ Robinson impressing early in camp
* WR Mack Hollins has added muscle and showed out so far
* Eddie Goldman is considering retirement again
* Agreed to terms with DT Justin Ellis
* Waived RB Caleb Huntley
* TE Mycole Pruitt re-signed

It appears things are going to be good hear in Atlanta. The team welcomed the largest crowd by far that they have had in the last few years to watch training camp. Good to see QB Ridder getting his footing and early and contributions some expected names are making such Mack Hollins. It appears this team is going to have plenty of depth and a much more dynamic offensive identity.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Re-signed CB Trayvon Mullen and place on non-football injury list
* QB Lamar Jackson turned down being on season 2 of the show Quarterback
* QB Lamar Jackson and WR OBJ building chemistry early
* Todd Monken feels QB Lamar Jackson will call plays better without wristband
* WR Zay Flowers has showcased his shiftiness
* Claimed WR Makai Polk off waivers
* Signed RB Melvin Gordon
* Could have interest in EDGE Chase Young
* Agreed to terms with Nick Moore

Overall it appears that things are going well for the team thus far this offseason. After the Lamar drama there has not been too much drama. They were able to sign Melvin Gordon to add some running back depth and apparently still have interest in acquiring Chase Young. They appear to be adding the right pieces to be a very difficult team to beat this year. It will be interesting to watch how QB Lamar Jackson does this year without a wristband as well as something that OC Todd Monken is pushing him to do.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* TE Kincaid has impressed thus far early on
* RB James Cook has been making plays and team is working to get him involved
* Connection between QB Allen and WR Diggs looking strong thus far
* WR Diggs addressed the media at length and cleared the air on earlier offseason confusion
* Kim Pegula attends first practice since 2022 cardiac arrest
* Signed Kyron Brown and waived/injured Cam Dantzler
* Released WR Jalen Wayne
* WR Trent Sherfield has been standing out in practice
* Signed WR Andy Isabella and released WR Jalen Wayne
* Worked out WR N’Keal Harry
* CB Damar Hamlin is full-go at practice
* Signed RB Darrynton Evans

All is well with the Bills. QB Josh Allen is looking crisp overall and has been working well with a variety of different targets. WR Gabe Davis looks healthy and had a good week besides one end zone drill where he and Allen stayed after to work on it. Also, itw as a good move by WR Stefon Diggs to take the time to address the media and clear the air following his comments made earlier in the offseason about the team. I think that all the attention not being on them and some of that getting sucked up by the Jets may help this team play looser this year.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* CB CJ Henderson sees this as a big year for him after team declined 5th-year option
* QB Bryce Young has had his moments where he has wowed teammates
* HC Frank Reich confirmed that QB Bryce Young is the team’s starter

It is official the #1 pick Bryce Young is the starting QB for the Panthers. Overall he has had his struggles with his fair share of highlights in camp thus far that have wowed teammates like just about any rookie. What is key here for Young is that he takes full advantage of the coaching staff he has and how QB friendly they appear to be.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore have built a lot of chemistry thus far
* OT Darnell Wright accidentally trained for the WR conditioning test
* WR Velus Jones Jr. has shown significant improvement
* WR Chase Claypool understands the importance of this year
* Have interest in signing DE Justin Houston
* TE Cole Kmet signed 4-year $50m extension
* Reports say QB Justin Fields has been shredding the defense
* Signed Isaiah Ford and Buddy Johnson

Vibes are high at camp here and it seems the media is doing a lot to try and hype them up. They signed TE Cole Kmet to a 4-year extension and may have interest in DE Justin Houston or some other pass rusher. QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore have established a lot of chemistry early and have looked good in practice thus far. Some funny news is that OT Darnell Wright accidentally prepped for the WR conditioning test so when it came time to do his conditioning test it was actually relatively easy. Maybe it is something that will be implemented as a standard to help folks make sure they are in shape.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* QB Joe Burrow out several weeks with calf strain
   * Signed QB Reid Sinnett
* DE Trey Hendrickson signed a 1-year extension with $21m in new money

Best news possible following the QB Joe Burrow injury is that it is a just a calf strain and it sounds like he will miss several weeks but still has a chance to start the season on the field. This could have been a lot worse and scared a lot of folks. DE Trey Hendrickson has been a difference maker on defense the past few years and getting a 1-year extension done is a great move. Now the question still remain about what QB Joe Burrow’s contract will look like and should happen any day now.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* HC Kevin Stefanski makes team run sprints after fights
* QB Deshaun Watson has been tearing it up at camp

Sounds like HC Kevin Stefanski knows how to punish guys because I definitely am not a fan of running and it doesn’t appear that anyone really is because it is always the first choice for a punishment when mistakes are made. In this instance it is dealing with team fights that folks across the league have been dealing with. On another note it sounds like QB Deshaun Watson is benefiting from not having the legal troubles to deal with that he did last year and is starting practice strong.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* CB Trevon Diggs missed practice time with bruised toe
* Owner Jerry Jones says that Zach Martin deal is still outstanding because have to save money to pay Micah Parsons
* Signed CB Trevon Diggs to a 5-year $97m extension
* RB Deuce Vaughn is looking shifty and quick in camp
* QB Dak Prescott turned down season 2 of the Quarterback show
* WR CeeDee Lamb is not worried about his contract and letting agent handle it
* S Donovan Wilson is expected to be out 4-6 weeks

There is a lot going on here. First off, good to see they got a deal done with CB Trevon Diggs and have him locked up for quite some time now. The concern comes with the fact that they haven’t gotten a deal done with WR Lamb yet and have their top offensive lineman holding out and not practicing with the team. It sounds like they have a lot to get worked out before they have to pay Micah Parsons next year who may be making a deal difficult for some of his teammates. It seems like this isn’t a great thing to say from owner Jerry Jones and some of these owners need to be a little more careful with how they deal with the media. More on this later when we get to the Colts. Other than contract stuff S Donovan Wilson is out 4-6 weeks and RB Deuce Vaughn has looked really impressive thus far and is looking to be a Darren Sproles type contributor.

**Denver Broncos:**

* HC Sean Payton called out former HC Nathaniel Hackett and the Jets as a whole
   * Went back on comments and said they were a mistake
* Signed K Brett Maher

Not too much news here other than the surprising comments/attack that Sean Payton directed towards former Broncos HC Nathaniel Hackett and the Jets as a whole. Payton claims it was a mistake and he forgot to “take off” his sport commentator/analyst camp. Either way he said what he said and we can look forward to an exciting game that will take place on October 8th.

**Detroit Lions:**

* OT Penei Sewell is in concussion protocol
* WR Jameson Williams has been very impressive in his short amount of practice thus far
* CB CJ Gardner Johnson back at practice after injury scare
* WR Denzel Mims enjoying the change of scenery

Some troubling news that Penei Sewell is in concussion protocol but it is early enough that he should recover long before the season begins. I bet Lions fans are still wishing that WR Jameson Williams was able to start the season on the field but they will have to wait to see what a lot his teammates are calling the best young receiver in the league. He only had 1 catch this year so he has nowhere to go but up.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* Released Jonathan Garvin
* QB Jordan Love got reached out to by QB Aaron Rodgers offering words of encouragement
* HC Matt LaFleur says that QB Jordan Love has total command of the offense
* QB Jacob Eason worked out for the team

The media has not been super loud about the Packers which I see as a good sign because if QB Jordan Love was struggling it would be all over the news cycles because it attaches to QB Aaron Rodgers and all else that goes on in New York. Since he is not in the media that much and reports have been good it is likely very good news for Packers fans that they have another franchise quarterback. Obviously it is too early to tell but I would not be surprised if things work out very well for the team.

**Houston Texans:**

* Team views QB CJ Stroud as the starting QB
   * Stroud and Mills still each taking 1st team reps at practice
* WR John Metchie looking good in practice just a year after the cancer diagnosis
* WR Tank Dell has impressed lots of folks early
* Will Anderson has impressed thus far in camp with Von Miller-like abilities
* Waived WR Amari Rodgers
* Activated veterans DT Sheldon Rankins and CB Kendall Sheffield
* Signed Tackle George Fant
* RT Tytus Howard signed 3-year $56m extension

While the team views QB Stroud as the #1 guy it sounds like the coaching staff is not quite as convinced yet and still has both taking first team reps and have decided not to name a starter just yet. The young WRs are looking good and that is important given that other options are pretty limited at the position and the early reports of Will Anderson have been good. The team signed RT Tytus Howard to a 3-year $56m extension which I am sure both rookie QBs are happy about and a good move by the team to get that done. The Texans are another team that has done a good job of avoiding too many distractions and not getting too much media attention despite having 2 of the top 3 picks in the draft with them in training camp.

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* RB Jonathan Taylor requested a trade after Jim Irsay’s comments
   * The two sides have been meeting this past week
* QB Anthony Richardson working with 1s and impressing early
   * Looked really good on medium to deep throws and struggled a bit on short ones
* Signed Isaac Taylor-Stuart and waived Cole Coleman
* Placed DE Tyquan Lewis, TE Will Mallory, and RB Jonathan Taylor on the PUP list
* Team oddly might move RB Jonathan Taylor from PUP to the NFI claiming a back injury even though he has never mentioned one

Ohh my….right when things are starting to look good for this organization they come tumbling down. It is almost like there is an Andrew Luck curse or something for the team not doing a good job of protecting him during his time. Owner Jim Irsay ran his mouth and frustrated RB Jonathan Taylor and now it has made an already unsure situation extremely tense. This seems like it is going to be a difficult one to resolve at this point because neither side appears to want to budge and there is unlikely to be a good trade partner who would be willing to give up much.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* RB Travis Etienne looking quick thus far
* WR Calvin Ridley looking good in camp and working to get reputation and name back

Not too much news out of the Jaguars but WR Ridley is looking good and like the WR1 he was before his suspension. RB Travis Etienne is looking healthy and strong. If he can be healthy then I think it will go a long way for QB Lawrence who will have a safety blanket in difficult situations.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress at training camp
* TE Travis Kelce got into a skirmish and talks to stepping up as a leader
   * HC Andy Reid commented as welling saying there is no place for fighting and met with TE Travis Kelce to address his fighting issues
* WR Marques Valdes-Scantling has been taking on leadership role among WRs
* Signed Ty Scott
* WR John Ross retired

First off, it sounds like the Chiefs are going to do a lot with the WRs and targets they have in the building. QB Mahomes makes that possible and has been working well with all the young and inexperienced talent at the WR position the team has. In other news TE Travis Kelce has been having fighting issues that appear to be very one sided as him being the aggressor and the main punch thrower. I know teammates chirp and do things to bother each other in these practices but like folks have said already fighting is not okay and there is no excuse. The videos released don’t make Kelce look all that good and as a leader on the team like others have said he needs to be above that. He is the best TE in the league so people are going to be consistently coming at him both in practice and during the regular season. He has not been known to have this issue so it should be something that gets cleared up but definitely something that needed to addressed and taken care of early so that it doesn’t result in other issues down the road.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* WR Hunter Renfrow feels he let his teammates down last year
* Rumors WR Davante Adams may not be happy…likely false
* Tom Brady’s ownership stake could be in jeopardy after new ownership laws put in place
* Brought back DL Kyle Peko
* Signed Isaac Rochell

Interesting how quickly rumors about WR Davante Adams was unhappy came out. Later it came out that those were false rumors but it felt like the media was almost trying to get WR Adams to feel that way and push him towards New York. Interesting to hear WR Hunter Renfrow come out and say he feels like he lets his teammates down last year since recently rumors have come out that he might be fighting for his spot to make the team and could be released.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* Signed Blake Lynch
* QB Justin Herbert and WR Quentin Johnston connecting on deep balls
* Signed WR Milton Wright
* Signed QB Justin Herbert to a $262.5m contract w/ $133.7m guaranteed

The Chargers have their franchise quarterback and hopefully they can take better advantage of this one than they did the last one. The Chargers have scored more point than any other team since Herbert but also have allowed the most point of any team so clearly that is not the best winning formula. It appears though on offense they won’t stop putting up a lot of points with rookie WR Quentin Johnston showing out thus far. We shall see if the defense can stay healthy and step up this year.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Signed RB Royce Freeman
* RB Sony Michel retired after just signing with the team a month ago
* WRs DeMarcus Robinson and Tyler Johnson off to a great start in WR3 battle
* QB Stetson Bennett and WR Puka Nacua impressing early in camp
* DL Aaron Donald still feels he has something to prove
* WR Cooper Kupp finding his groove again
* QB Matt Stafford and WR Van Jefferson got a ton of work in this offseason

Surprise retirement from RB Sony Michel a month after signing with the team. Other than that things appear to be going well but it really doesn’t feel or seem like the team has anywhere near the same excitement and talent as they did just 2 years ago when they won the Super Bowl. This will be an interesting team to watch going forward and just how things end up panning out.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* Activated Isaiah Wynn
* QB Tua Tagavailoa feeling healthier and more confident than ever
   * Turned down the Quarterback show
* Signed CB Eli Apple to a 1-year deal
   * CB Eli Apple and WR Tyreek Hill appear to have squashed their beef
* CB Jalen Ramsey had surgery on his meniscus and is likely out til December
* WR Tyreek Hill reached settlement

Tough news this week with CB Jalen Ramsey having meniscus surgery for a fully torn mensicus and being out til December most likely so who do they bring in. CB Eli Apple who had been known to have beef with WR Tyreek Hill. Appears all is good now and WR Hill probably thankful something else about him was talked about in the media other than his recent legal troubles.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Signed Danielle Hunter to a 1-year $20m deal with $17m guaranteed
* WR Justin Jefferson has not lost a step and is making incredible plays early and often
* WR Jordan Addison making plays early

Not too much news overall besides the team doing a good job and getting a deal done with Danielle Hunter to a 1-year deal. He will definitely be a good guy to have around to help continue to lead the defense after an offseason of changes on that side of the ball.

**New England Patriots:**

* HC Bill Belichick raved about WR Kendrick Bourne and the impact he has
* WR Demario Douglas has impressed thus far
* Hosted RB Ezekiel Elliott for a visit
* Team and EDGE Matthew Judon have had open dialogue about contract
* CB Christian Gonzalez has been impressive from the start
* DL Christian Barmore excused from camp for birth of his child
* Signed WR Jalen Hurd

Overall it has sounded like defense and offense have been very evenly matched thus far but that QB Mac Jones has looked the best thus far of the QBs. Good to see him taking charge and taking back his spot. Sounds like RB Ezekiel Elliott had a good visit and remain in contact with the team. This should be an exciting year for the Patriots!

**New Orleans Saints:**

* DE Jabari Zenga retired
* Signed Long Snapper Zach Wood to a record breaking 4-year contract extension worth over $5.3m and $2.3m guaranteed
* Signed TE Jimmy Graham to a 1-year deal
* Signed G Max Garcia

Yes, you read that right TE Jimmy Graham signed with the Saints to play not to coach or just have a retirement ceremony. This one definitely came as a surprise but it sure seems like he has stayed in pretty good shape and maybe the time away gave him the time he needed to heal. Other than that they have the richest long snapper after signing him to a record breaking deal.

**New York Giants:**

* WR Darius Slayton practiced with tennis balls to improve his hands
* TE Darren Waller has been turning heads at practice thus far and is ungaurdable
* WR Jalin Hyatt is impressing a lot of folks and already working with the 1s
* RT Evan Neal lost 10-15 pounds while adding muscle
* Activated WRs Sterling Shepard and Jamison Crowder
* Signed LT Andrew Thomas to a 5-year $117.5m extension with $67m guaranteed
* Signed RB Saquon Barkley to an adjusted 1-year franchise tag worth $11m
* Signed DL Tashawn Bower

Big news here was after the long drama between Barkley and the team he ended up signing an adjusted franchise tag that nets him about another million dollars. Other than that though TE Darren Waller has been unguardable basically in practice and WR Jalin Hyatt has been working in with the 1s. Also, the team locked up LT Andrew Thomas with a 5-year $117.5m extension. They are doing all right things to set QB Daniel Jones up for a ton of success this year. If he is not able to put it together this year there are going to be a lot of offseason questions. All early signs though make it sound like the Giants have been making all the right moves.

**New York Jets:**

* QB Aaron Rodgers fired back at HC Sean Payton in an on-field interview
   * Took a $35m paycut and now contract is a 2-year $75m guaranteed contract
* OT Duane Brown is progressing well but has no timetable on return
* RB Dalvin Cook visited the team and they are the favorite to sign him
   * QB Aaron Rodgers talked to him before drills at camp
* QB Zach Wilson and OT Mekhi Bekton to play in HOF game
   * Will not play starters overall in this game
* WR Garrett Wilson has looked really good but suffered a low ankle sprain
* RB Breece Hall expected back in a couple of weeks
* Activated WR Randall Cobb
* WR Jason Brownlee has been impressive thus far

Wow, the media does not rest with this Jets team. It seems like every little thing that happens is headline news here. RB Dalvin Cook appears to have a strong preference to sign with the team if they can get a good enough deal on the table. That should be possible after QB Aaron Rodgers took his paycut. I know the paycut is a lot but the amount of money Rodgers stands to make being with NY media probably greatly outweighs what he gave up in his contract. It has been all good news from the team thus far though besides a few bumps and bruises with some guys. Will be exciting to see some of the backups in the HOF game Thursday.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* Potentially in the market to add a safety
* CB Darius Slay and coach Matt Patricia had a man-to-man conversation about issues back in Detroit but all is in the past now and they settled their differences
* WR Quez Watkins has been impressing a lot early in camp
* Bringing back the “Kelly Green” uniforms
* LB Hasson Reddick started doing individual work as he recovers from a groin injury
* Rookies Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter have been dominating
* DE Derek Barnett agreed to a restructured contract

Rookie defensive picks Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter have been dominant. I think that last sentence is something everyone feared. The Eagles defense was good enough last year and to maybe only get stronger even after some key losses is not a good sign for opponents. In other news the Eagles are bringing back their “Kelly Green” uniforms this year and these may have been the most highly anticipated uniforms. This team has appeared to takea. few more steps forward this offseason!

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* Signed LB Kwon Alexander
* Rookie FB Monte Pottebaum retired
* WR George Pickens is looking forward to more deep shots this year
   * Got into it with teammate CB Joey Porter

Not too much news here but good move to sign LB Kwon Alexander and WR George Pickens is looking as dominant as ever at practice but needs to avoid the skirmishes. This team is one to watch to make a big jump.

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* RB room looking really strong early in the year as it always is
* QB Brock Purdy appears to have his arm strength back after early concerns
   * Will need to shake off a bit of rust though as there have been early struggles
* DE Nick Bosa still holding out and no contract yet
* WR Brandon Aiyuk looking like the best player on the team thus far
* Added Frank Gore and Dashon Goldson to coaching staff
* Signed LB Kyahva Tezinio
* Signed CB Terrance Mitchell to a 1-year deal

Most of the news here has been about the 4 QBs all getting a pretty good amount of reps this offseason and really overall none of them looking that good thus far. If there is a list it would probably go Darnold and Purdy tied for 1st with Lance right behind them and Brandon Allen a distant 4th as expected. It has been interesting though because the top 3 have all struggled in different ways but none of them have been good. The thing though that Darnold and Purdy have going for them though is that Purdy has been recovering from surgery and needs some time to shake off the rust and for Darnold it is a new offense. Has Kyle Shanahan given up on Lance or is he about to? If he does, will he be traded soon? All reasonable questions that no one has any idea about. Other notable news is that no deal has gotten done with DE Nick Bosa still and it would be nice to have him practicing by now.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* RB Kenneth Walker has missed practices and may continue for some time as he deals with a groin issue
* RB Zach Charbonnet got checked by docs for a shoulder injury and is out indefinitely at the moment
* TE Noah Fant passed his physical and activated off PUP list
* RB Kenny McIntosh has been extremely impressive early
* QB Geno Smith turned down the Quarterback show for season 2
* Signed DB Chris Steele
* S Jamal Adams and LB Jordyn Brooks on the PUP list
* Signed LB Uchenna Nwosu to a 3-year $45m extension

Tough week for RBs with the Seahawks because of injuries to Walker and Charbonnet. However, the good news is that they have a lot depth there and everyone has looked really good that they have put at the position. TE Noah Fant was able to pass his physical and get activated off the PUP list. Other notable news was signing LB Uchenna Nwosu to a 3-year $45m extension. Great move by the team to get a key defensive piece locked up and happy.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* DT Calijah Kancey carted off the field with a right leg injury
* Signed DL William Gholston to a 1-year $2.8m contract
* LB Devin White reported to camp

Not much news from the team but good to hear that LB Devin White did indeed report to camp after some offseason troubles. Still appears that Baker Mayfield will be QB1 and may even have a bit of a career resurgence.

* Eddie Goldman is considering retirement again
* Agreed to terms with DT Justin Ellis

* TE Mycole Pruitt re-signed

Good to see QB Ridder getting his footing and early and contributions some expected names are making such Mack Hollins. It appears this team is going to have plenty of depth and a much more dynamic offensive identity.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Re-signed CB Trayvon Mullen and place on non-football injury list
* QB Lamar Jackson turned down being on season 2 of the show Quarterback
* QB Lamar Jackson and WR OBJ building chemistry early
* Todd Monken feels QB Lamar Jackson will call plays better without wristband
* WR Zay Flowers has showcased his shiftiness
* Claimed WR Makai Polk off waivers
* Signed RB Melvin Gordon
* Could have interest in EDGE Chase Young
* Agreed to terms with Nick Moore

Overall it appears that things are going well for the team thus far this offseason. After the Lamar drama there has not been too much drama. They were able to sign Melvin Gordon to add some running back depth and apparently still have interest in acquiring Chase Young. They appear to be adding the right pieces to be a very difficult team to beat this year. It will be interesting to watch how QB Lamar Jackson does this year without a wristband as well as something that OC Todd Monken is pushing him to do.

* WR Diggs addressed the media at length and cleared the air on earlier offseason confusion

* WR Trent Sherfield has been standing out in practice
* Signed WR Andy Isabella and released WR Jalen Wayne
* Worked out WR N’Keal Harry
* CB Damar Hamlin is full-go at practice
* Signed RB Darrynton Evans

All is well with the Bills. QB Josh Allen is looking crisp overall and has been working well with a variety of different targets. WR Gabe Davis looks healthy and had a good week besides one end zone drill where he and Allen stayed after to work on it. Also, itw as a good move by WR Stefon Diggs to take the time to address the media and clear the air following his comments made earlier in the offseason about the team. I think that all the attention not being on them and some of that getting sucked up by the Jets may help this team play looser this year.

Overall he has had his struggles with his fair share of highlights in camp thus far that have wowed teammates like just about any rookie. What is key here for Young is that he takes full advantage of the coaching staff he has and how QB friendly they appear to be.

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore have built a lot of chemistry thus far
* OT Darnell Wright accidentally trained for the WR conditioning test
* WR Velus Jones Jr. has shown significant improvement
* WR Chase Claypool understands the importance of this year
* Have interest in signing DE Justin Houston
* TE Cole Kmet signed 4-year $50m extension
* Reports say QB Justin Fields has been shredding the defense
* Signed Isaiah Ford and Buddy Johnson

Vibes are high at camp here and it seems the media is doing a lot to try and hype them up. They signed TE Cole Kmet to a 4-year extension and may have interest in DE Justin Houston or some other pass rusher. QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore have established a lot of chemistry early and have looked good in practice thus far. Some funny news is that OT Darnell Wright accidentally prepped for the WR conditioning test so when it came time to do his conditioning test it was actually relatively easy. Maybe it is something that will be implemented as a standard to help folks make sure they are in shape.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* QB Joe Burrow out several weeks with calf strain
   * Signed QB Reid Sinnett
* DE Trey Hendrickson signed a 1-year extension with $21m in new money

Best news possible following the QB Joe Burrow injury is that it is a just a calf strain and it sounds like he will miss several weeks but still has a chance to start the season on the field. This could have been a lot worse and scared a lot of folks. DE Trey Hendrickson has been a difference maker on defense the past few years and getting a 1-year extension done is a great move. Now the question still remain about what QB Joe Burrow’s contract will look like and should happen any day now.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* HC Kevin Stefanski makes team run sprints after fights
* QB Deshaun Watson has been tearing it up at camp

Sounds like HC Kevin Stefanski knows how to punish guys because I definitely am not a fan of running and it doesn’t appear that anyone really is because it is always the first choice for a punishment when mistakes are made. In this instance it is dealing with team fights that folks across the league have been dealing with. On another note it sounds like QB Deshaun Watson is benefiting from not having the legal troubles to deal with that he did last year and is starting practice strong.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* CB Trevon Diggs missed practice time with bruised toe
* Owner Jerry Jones says that Zach Martin deal is still outstanding because have to save money to pay Micah Parsons
* Signed CB Trevon Diggs to a 5-year $97m extension
* RB Deuce Vaughn is looking shifty and quick in camp
* QB Dak Prescott turned down season 2 of the Quarterback show
* WR CeeDee Lamb is not worried about his contract and letting agent handle it
* S Donovan Wilson is expected to be out 4-6 weeks

There is a lot going on here. First off, good to see they got a deal done with CB Trevon Diggs and have him locked up for quite some time now. The concern comes with the fact that they haven’t gotten a deal done with WR Lamb yet and have their top offensive lineman holding out and not practicing with the team. It sounds like they have a lot to get worked out before they have to pay Micah Parsons next year who may be making a deal difficult for some of his teammates. It seems like this isn’t a great thing to say from owner Jerry Jones and some of these owners need to be a little more careful with how they deal with the media. More on this later when we get to the Colts. Other than contract stuff S Donovan Wilson is out 4-6 weeks and RB Deuce Vaughn has looked really impressive thus far and is looking to be a Darren Sproles type contributor.

**Denver Broncos:**

* HC Sean Payton called out former HC Nathaniel Hackett and the Jets as a whole
   * Went back on comments and said they were a mistake
* Signed K Brett Maher

Not too much news here other than the surprising comments/attack that Sean Payton directed towards former Broncos HC Nathaniel Hackett and the Jets as a whole. Payton claims it was a mistake and he forgot to “take off” his sport commentator/analyst camp. Either way he said what he said and we can look forward to an exciting game that will take place on October 8th.

**Detroit Lions:**

* OT Penei Sewell is in concussion protocol
* WR Jameson Williams has been very impressive in his short amount of practice thus far
* CB CJ Gardner Johnson back at practice after injury scare
* WR Denzel Mims enjoying the change of scenery

Some troubling news that Penei Sewell is in concussion protocol but it is early enough that he should recover long before the season begins. I bet Lions fans are still wishing that WR Jameson Williams was able to start the season on the field but they will have to wait to see what a lot his teammates are calling the best young receiver in the league. He only had 1 catch this year so he has nowhere to go but up.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* Released Jonathan Garvin
* QB Jordan Love got reached out to by QB Aaron Rodgers offering words of encouragement
* HC Matt LaFleur says that QB Jordan Love has total command of the offense
* QB Jacob Eason worked out for the team

The media has not been super loud about the Packers which I see as a good sign because if QB Jordan Love was struggling it would be all over the news cycles because it attaches to QB Aaron Rodgers and all else that goes on in New York. Since he is not in the media that much and reports have been good it is likely very good news for Packers fans that they have another franchise quarterback. Obviously it is too early to tell but I would not be surprised if things work out very well for the team.

**Houston Texans:**

* Team views QB CJ Stroud as the starting QB
   * Stroud and Mills still each taking 1st team reps at practice
* WR John Metchie looking good in practice just a year after the cancer diagnosis
* WR Tank Dell has impressed lots of folks early
* Will Anderson has impressed thus far in camp with Von Miller-like abilities
* Waived WR Amari Rodgers
* Activated veterans DT Sheldon Rankins and CB Kendall Sheffield
* Signed Tackle George Fant
* RT Tytus Howard signed 3-year $56m extension

While the team views QB Stroud as the #1 guy it sounds like the coaching staff is not quite as convinced yet and still has both taking first team reps and have decided not to name a starter just yet. The young WRs are looking good and that is important given that other options are pretty limited at the position and the early reports of Will Anderson have been good. The team signed RT Tytus Howard to a 3-year $56m extension which I am sure both rookie QBs are happy about and a good move by the team to get that done. The Texans are another team that has done a good job of avoiding too many distractions and not getting too much media attention despite having 2 of the top 3 picks in the draft with them in training camp.

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* RB Jonathan Taylor requested a trade after Jim Irsay’s comments
   * The two sides have been meeting this past week
* QB Anthony Richardson working with 1s and impressing early
   * Looked really good on medium to deep throws and struggled a bit on short ones
* Signed Isaac Taylor-Stuart and waived Cole Coleman
* Placed DE Tyquan Lewis, TE Will Mallory, and RB Jonathan Taylor on the PUP list
* Team oddly might move RB Jonathan Taylor from PUP to the NFI claiming a back injury even though he has never mentioned one

Ohh my….right when things are starting to look good for this organization they come tumbling down. It is almost like there is an Andrew Luck curse or something for the team not doing a good job of protecting him during his time. Owner Jim Irsay ran his mouth and frustrated RB Jonathan Taylor and now it has made an already unsure situation extremely tense. This seems like it is going to be a difficult one to resolve at this point because neither side appears to want to budge and there is unlikely to be a good trade partner who would be willing to give up much.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* RB Travis Etienne looking quick thus far
* WR Calvin Ridley looking good in camp and working to get reputation and name back

Not too much news out of the Jaguars but WR Ridley is looking good and like the WR1 he was before his suspension. RB Travis Etienne is looking healthy and strong. If he can be healthy then I think it will go a long way for QB Lawrence who will have a safety blanket in difficult situations.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress at training camp
* TE Travis Kelce got into a skirmish and talks to stepping up as a leader
   * HC Andy Reid commented as welling saying there is no place for fighting and met with TE Travis Kelce to address his fighting issues
* WR Marques Valdes-Scantling has been taking on leadership role among WRs
* Signed Ty Scott
* WR John Ross retired

First off, it sounds like the Chiefs are going to do a lot with the WRs and targets they have in the building. QB Mahomes makes that possible and has been working well with all the young and inexperienced talent at the WR position the team has. In other news TE Travis Kelce has been having fighting issues that appear to be very one sided as him being the aggressor and the main punch thrower. I know teammates chirp and do things to bother each other in these practices but like folks have said already fighting is not okay and there is no excuse. The videos released don’t make Kelce look all that good and as a leader on the team like others have said he needs to be above that. He is the best TE in the league so people are going to be consistently coming at him both in practice and during the regular season. He has not been known to have this issue so it should be something that gets cleared up but definitely something that needed to addressed and taken care of early so that it doesn’t result in other issues down the road.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* WR Hunter Renfrow feels he let his teammates down last year
* Rumors WR Davante Adams may not be happy…likely false
* Tom Brady’s ownership stake could be in jeopardy after new ownership laws put in place
* Brought back DL Kyle Peko
* Signed Isaac Rochell

Interesting how quickly rumors about WR Davante Adams was unhappy came out. Later it came out that those were false rumors but it felt like the media was almost trying to get WR Adams to feel that way and push him towards New York. Interesting to hear WR Hunter Renfrow come out and say he feels like he lets his teammates down last year since recently rumors have come out that he might be fighting for his spot to make the team and could be released.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* Signed Blake Lynch
* QB Justin Herbert and WR Quentin Johnston connecting on deep balls
* Signed WR Milton Wright
* Signed QB Justin Herbert to a $262.5m contract w/ $133.7m guaranteed

The Chargers have their franchise quarterback and hopefully they can take better advantage of this one than they did the last one. The Chargers have scored more point than any other team since Herbert but also have allowed the most point of any team so clearly that is not the best winning formula. It appears though on offense they won’t stop putting up a lot of points with rookie WR Quentin Johnston showing out thus far. We shall see if the defense can stay healthy and step up this year.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Signed RB Royce Freeman
* RB Sony Michel retired after just signing with the team a month ago
* WRs DeMarcus Robinson and Tyler Johnson off to a great start in WR3 battle
* QB Stetson Bennett and WR Puka Nacua impressing early in camp
* DL Aaron Donald still feels he has something to prove
* WR Cooper Kupp finding his groove again
* QB Matt Stafford and WR Van Jefferson got a ton of work in this offseason

Surprise retirement from RB Sony Michel a month after signing with the team. Other than that things appear to be going well but it really doesn’t feel or seem like the team has anywhere near the same excitement and talent as they did just 2 years ago when they won the Super Bowl. This will be an interesting team to watch going forward and just how things end up panning out.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* Activated Isaiah Wynn
* QB Tua Tagavailoa feeling healthier and more confident than ever
   * Turned down the Quarterback show
* Signed CB Eli Apple to a 1-year deal
   * CB Eli Apple and WR Tyreek Hill appear to have squashed their beef
* CB Jalen Ramsey had surgery on his meniscus and is likely out til December
* WR Tyreek Hill reached settlement

Tough news this week with CB Jalen Ramsey having meniscus surgery for a fully torn mensicus and being out til December most likely so who do they bring in. CB Eli Apple who had been known to have beef with WR Tyreek Hill. Appears all is good now and WR Hill probably thankful something else about him was talked about in the media other than his recent legal troubles.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Signed Danielle Hunter to a 1-year $20m deal with $17m guaranteed
* WR Justin Jefferson has not lost a step and is making incredible plays early and often
* WR Jordan Addison making plays early

Not too much news overall besides the team doing a good job and getting a deal done with Danielle Hunter to a 1-year deal. He will definitely be a good guy to have around to help continue to lead the defense after an offseason of changes on that side of the ball.

**New England Patriots:**

* HC Bill Belichick raved about WR Kendrick Bourne and the impact he has
* WR Demario Douglas has impressed thus far
* Hosted RB Ezekiel Elliott for a visit
* Team and EDGE Matthew Judon have had open dialogue about contract
* CB Christian Gonzalez has been impressive from the start
* DL Christian Barmore excused from camp for birth of his child
* Signed WR Jalen Hurd

Overall it has sounded like defense and offense have been very evenly matched thus far but that QB Mac Jones has looked the best thus far of the QBs. Good to see him taking charge and taking back his spot. Sounds like RB Ezekiel Elliott had a good visit and remain in contact with the team. This should be an exciting year for the Patriots!

**New Orleans Saints:**

* DE Jabari Zenga retired
* Signed Long Snapper Zach Wood to a record breaking 4-year contract extension worth over $5.3m and $2.3m guaranteed
* Signed TE Jimmy Graham to a 1-year deal
* Signed G Max Garcia

Yes, you read that right TE Jimmy Graham signed with the Saints to play not to coach or just have a retirement ceremony. This one definitely came as a surprise but it sure seems like he has stayed in pretty good shape and maybe the time away gave him the time he needed to heal. Other than that they have the richest long snapper after signing him to a record breaking deal.

**New York Giants:**

* WR Darius Slayton practiced with tennis balls to improve his hands
* TE Darren Waller has been turning heads at practice thus far and is ungaurdable
* WR Jalin Hyatt is impressing a lot of folks and already working with the 1s
* RT Evan Neal lost 10-15 pounds while adding muscle
* Activated WRs Sterling Shepard and Jamison Crowder
* Signed LT Andrew Thomas to a 5-year $117.5m extension with $67m guaranteed
* Signed RB Saquon Barkley to an adjusted 1-year franchise tag worth $11m
* Signed DL Tashawn Bower

Big news here was after the long drama between Barkley and the team he ended up signing an adjusted franchise tag that nets him about another million dollars. Other than that though TE Darren Waller has been unguardable basically in practice and WR Jalin Hyatt has been working in with the 1s. Also, the team locked up LT Andrew Thomas with a 5-year $117.5m extension. They are doing all right things to set QB Daniel Jones up for a ton of success this year. If he is not able to put it together this year there are going to be a lot of offseason questions. All early signs though make it sound like the Giants have been making all the right moves.

**New York Jets:**

* QB Aaron Rodgers fired back at HC Sean Payton in an on-field interview
   * Took a $35m paycut and now contract is a 2-year $75m guaranteed contract
* OT Duane Brown is progressing well but has no timetable on return
* RB Dalvin Cook visited the team and they are the favorite to sign him
   * QB Aaron Rodgers talked to him before drills at camp
* QB Zach Wilson and OT Mekhi Bekton to play in HOF game
   * Will not play starters overall in this game
* WR Garrett Wilson has looked really good but suffered a low ankle sprain
* RB Breece Hall expected back in a couple of weeks
* Activated WR Randall Cobb
* WR Jason Brownlee has been impressive thus far

Wow, the media does not rest with this Jets team. It seems like every little thing that happens is headline news here. RB Dalvin Cook appears to have a strong preference to sign with the team if they can get a good enough deal on the table. That should be possible after QB Aaron Rodgers took his paycut. I know the paycut is a lot but the amount of money Rodgers stands to make being with NY media probably greatly outweighs what he gave up in his contract. It has been all good news from the team thus far though besides a few bumps and bruises with some guys. Will be exciting to see some of the backups in the HOF game Thursday.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* Potentially in the market to add a safety
* CB Darius Slay and coach Matt Patricia had a man-to-man conversation about issues back in Detroit but all is in the past now and they settled their differences
* WR Quez Watkins has been impressing a lot early in camp
* Bringing back the “Kelly Green” uniforms
* LB Hasson Reddick started doing individual work as he recovers from a groin injury
* Rookies Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter have been dominating
* DE Derek Barnett agreed to a restructured contract

Rookie defensive picks Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter have been dominant. I think that last sentence is something everyone feared. The Eagles defense was good enough last year and to maybe only get stronger even after some key losses is not a good sign for opponents. In other news the Eagles are bringing back their “Kelly Green” uniforms this year and these may have been the most highly anticipated uniforms. This team has appeared to takea. few more steps forward this offseason!

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* Signed LB Kwon Alexander
* Rookie FB Monte Pottebaum retired
* WR George Pickens is looking forward to more deep shots this year
   * Got into it with teammate CB Joey Porter

Not too much news here but good move to sign LB Kwon Alexander and WR George Pickens is looking as dominant as ever at practice but needs to avoid the skirmishes. This team is one to watch to make a big jump.

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* RB room looking really strong early in the year as it always is
* QB Brock Purdy appears to have his arm strength back after early concerns
   * Will need to shake off a bit of rust though as there have been early struggles
* DE Nick Bosa still holding out and no contract yet
* WR Brandon Aiyuk looking like the best player on the team thus far
* Added Frank Gore and Dashon Goldson to coaching staff
* Signed LB Kyahva Tezinio
* Signed CB Terrance Mitchell to a 1-year deal

Most of the news here has been about the 4 QBs all getting a pretty good amount of reps this offseason and really overall none of them looking that good thus far. If there is a list it would probably go Darnold and Purdy tied for 1st with Lance right behind them and Brandon Allen a distant 4th as expected. It has been interesting though because the top 3 have all struggled in different ways but none of them have been good. The thing though that Darnold and Purdy have going for them though is that Purdy has been recovering from surgery and needs some time to shake off the rust and for Darnold it is a new offense. Has Kyle Shanahan given up on Lance or is he about to? If he does, will he be traded soon? All reasonable questions that no one has any idea about. Other notable news is that no deal has gotten done with DE Nick Bosa still and it would be nice to have him practicing by now.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* RB Kenneth Walker has missed practices and may continue for some time as he deals with a groin issue
* RB Zach Charbonnet got checked by docs for a shoulder injury and is out indefinitely at the moment
* TE Noah Fant passed his physical and activated off PUP list
* RB Kenny McIntosh has been extremely impressive early
* QB Geno Smith turned down the Quarterback show for season 2
* Signed DB Chris Steele
* S Jamal Adams and LB Jordyn Brooks on the PUP list
* Signed LB Uchenna Nwosu to a 3-year $45m extension

Tough week for RBs with the Seahawks because of injuries to Walker and Charbonnet. However, the good news is that they have a lot depth there and everyone has looked really good that they have put at the position. TE Noah Fant was able to pass his physical and get activated off the PUP list. Other notable news was signing LB Uchenna Nwosu to a 3-year $45m extension. Great move by the team to get a key defensive piece locked up and happy.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* DT Calijah Kancey carted off the field with a right leg injury
* Signed DL William Gholston to a 1-year $2.8m contract
* LB Devin White reported to camp

Not much news from the team but good to hear that LB Devin White did indeed report to camp after some offseason troubles. Still appears that Baker Mayfield will be QB1 and may even have a bit of a career resurgence.

Quarterback Evaluations,nfl,"Whenever I see these off-season tier lists I get really confused and I am curious to hear how this sub perceives various quarterbacks and elements of their game.

For example, I am a Vikings fan. 

I think Kirk is a solid QB, but then I hear people compare Kirk to Dak or put them on the same level and I just don’t get it.

Dak is a complete player, he is above average to good in the play/pass game, the drop back game and as a runner.

Kirk on the other hand is elite in the play/pass game but gives you next to nothing in the drop back game or as a runner.

When looking at it that way how could you compare them as being on a similar level?

So I am curious, when you are considering where a QB stacks up, what are you considering to be important? 

Are you looking at what the QBs skill set allows your offense to do (like the Dak/Kirk example I gave).

|2021 Rams (Super Bowl)|\-.141|

Joe was AWFUL vs the Rams. The one TD he threw was a clear facemask on the Bengals WRs. Burrow and the offense went 3 and out 5 times in the 2nd half. They gained 62 yards on 31 plays on their final 6 drives.

Burrow had 2nd and 1 from the 50 yard line with 55 seconds left and they didn't get it. It is one of the 3 worst super bowls by EPA/play in NFL history (since 1999)

**Coaching Changes**: Shockingly? None. The Bengals went into the offseason appearing like they were going to lose both OC Brian Callahan and DC Lou Anarumo to head coaching jobs. Despite both of them going deep into interviews with multiple teams both coaches were retained in Cincinnati for another year. This might be the last year that this coaching tree has all of its limbs remain intact.

**Major Losses**

**Jessie Bates -** This is obviously the biggest one. Jessie was a cornerstone of the defense that took the Bengals to the Super Bowl just last year. It was relatively well known coming into this season that there was little to no chance Jessie was re-signing with the team once his franchise year was up. Jessie came into his free agency year and performed as you might expect a player who was heading for free agency to play. His overall tackles were down substantially, but he had a career high 4 interceptions and a forced fumble. Hes going to be a loss for this team.

**Vonn Bell -** A member of the Bengals 2020 free agency class Vonn Bell made an immediate impact on the team that reverberated for his entire tenure in Cincinnati. Vonn started throughout the entire Super Bowl run and was off to a roaring start last year with four interceptions and two forced fumbles through 9 games before disaster struck and he was injured. Vonn is an absolute impact player who will be missed by the defense as well.

**Samaje Perine -** Samaje is a player whos impact isnt entirely noticeable on just a cursory glance at the stats. However any further deep dive and you see how good he actually was. With only two starts Samaje amassed 394 rushing yards and 287 receiving yards. He was more than serviceable change of pace back who frankly performed at starter levels at points in the season.

**Hayden Hurst -** Another player whos numbers don't quite tell the whole story. Hurst had 414 yards in the regular season which sounds like ""mid"" tight end numbers, but Hayden was a huge part of the offense. He played in 13 games and had 19 3rd down catches on 22 targets for an average of 7.4 yards per attempt. He also averaged 9.4 yards a catch on 1st down.

**Eli Apple -** Eli was seen as a backup last year and in the end had to take a much larger role in the team. Most assumed between Mike Hilton, Cam Taylor Britt, and Awuzie that Eli would seldom see the field, and boy most were wrong. Eli started 15 games with the Bengals.

**Kevin Huber/Clark Harris -** Well this may be one of those things that people look at and say ""wow you really consider a punter and long snapper major losses?"" Yes. Clark Joined in 2008, and Kevin Joined in 2009 making both guys the last hold outs of the Palmer era.

Clark Harris came into Cincinnati and helped bring stability to a position that frankly had been god awful prior to his arrival. He joined the team and was the long snapper for almost every game from when he joined in 2008 until his unfortunate injury against the Steelers in game one of last year.

Kevin Huber likewise was joined in the Palmer era out of a positional need. He was a draft pick out of the university of Cincinnati and set the record for games played by a Bengal last year at 216.

Both of these guys were invaluable to the franchise through three eras of Bengals football and will be missed.

**Players signed**

&amp;#x200B;

|Player|Position|Signed/Re-signed|Length|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Orlando Brown Jr|LT|Signed|4 Years|
|Germaine Pratt|Linebacker|Re-Signed|3 Years|

|Drew Sample|Tight End|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trevor Siemian|Quarter Back|Signed|1 year|
|Mitchell Wilcox|Tight End|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trey Hendrickson|Defensive End|Extended|1 year additional|

This is going to end up being an interesting free agency class. At face value most of the players are either re-signed or depth, however there are definitely going to be some impact players here.

**Orlando Brown Jr –** The biggest signing of the year shores up the left side of the Bengals offensive line for the next 4 years. Its no secret that the Bengals have had issues with the offensive line and have now spent two off seasons attempting to correct this. Orlando Brown Junior was arguably the best LT in free agency this year and the Bengals getting him and sliding Jonah Williams over to the right side was honestly shocking. If Orlando Brown is able to be the game changer the team thinks he is the Bengals offense should be even better.

**Germaine Pratt** – I think if you talked to most Bengals fans prior to free agency they’d have told you there was little chance that Pratt was coming back. To re-sign Pratt for 3 years is shoring up the LB position for the next 3 years and put the team into a better position to keep their defense operating at a high level.

**Nick Scott –** Nick is the immediate answer to replacing Vonn Bell, with the chance of Jordan Battle supplanting him in the future. He’s got big shoes to fill, and had a nice year in 2022 with the Rams with 86 tackles, two interceptions and two forced fumbles, not bad at all for a former 7th round pick.

**Irv Smith Jr –** This years stop on the “Bengals get a tight end a big contract with another team” train is Irv Smith Jr! Irv was drafted in the second round in 2019 by the Minnesota Vikings. He has 88 receptions for 844 yards and 9 touchdowns in his four year career. After what was done with Hayden Hurst last year I fully expect Irv to put up career highs in receptions, touchdowns, and yards, then for him to leave in free agency for 3/20.

**Draft Results**

|Round|Player|Position|School|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Myles Murphy|Edge|Clemson|
|2|DJ Turner|Cornerback|Michigan|
|3|Jordan Battle|Safety|Alabama|
|4|Charlie Jones|Wide Receiver|Purdue|
|5|Chase Brown|Running Back|Illinois|
|6|Andrei Iosivas|Wide Receiver|Princeton|
|6|Brad Robbins|Punter|Michigan|
|7|DJ Ivey|Cornerback|Miami|

I'm going to break these guys down into categories.

**Immediate Contributors:**

**Myles Murphy** \- I fully expect Murphy to have a big role this year. I don't know if he starts at all, and to an extent I don't think he does, but I expect him to get significant playing time at some point this year. One story that has come out in the offseason was from the Bengals strength coach about the fact that Murphy did 20 straight pull ups at his game weight of 280lbs then proceeded to run 20.1mph (GPS tracked).

**DJ Turner** \- With the loss of Eli Apple even with the return of Awuzie I expect second rounder DJ Turner to see significant playing time early. He reportedly ran the fastest 40 yard dash at the combine and should help improve the speed of a group that often felt like it got burned when Apple was targeted.

**Brad Robbins** \- As I mentioned previously the Bengals parted ways with Kevin Huber who has in turn retired. Drue Chrisman took over as the Punter for the Bengals and was serviceable but not what I would call elite. You don't invest a draft pick in a punter unless you think they have real talent. The Bengals have a training camp battle with Chrisman and Robbins for the punter of the future, if Robbins wins out he will be an immediate contributor this year.

**Possible Contributors this year:**

**Jordan Battle** \- With the addition of Nick Scott Battle doesn't have to be an immediate starter and that may be good. It will allow him to ease into the league. Battle has been quiet for the most part this off season but alabama fans rave about him. He could force his way into the starting line up if things fall his way.

**Chase Brown** \- The restructured deal for Mixon means the Bengals aren't necessarily looking for a new lead back right now. When Brown has talked to reporters hes talked about working on his run blocking more than anything else with pass catching short behind it. It sounds like theres a good chance he has already been told to plan on being a 3rd down back early on. If he has a role similar to Perine this year his impact could be massive.

**Maybe next year:**

**Charlie Jones and Andrei Iosivas** \- I wish the best for both of these guys, but honestly I don't understand these picks. No one reading this was muttering ""Wow the bengals need more Wide Receivers"" yet here we are. With Boyd, Chase, and Higgins as well as Mixon, Irv Smith, Trenton Irwin, and Trent Taylor I just don't see these guys getting much of a shot this year. I could be wrong, and if one of them breaks out it might make it easier for the team to move on from Boyd in the off season.

**DJ Ivey** \- I don't expect much this year out of Ivey with Turner drafted ahead of him, however hes gotten praise from CB coach Chuck Burks as being able to play the position ""at a high level"" and has been praised for his 4.46 speed. Speed really seems to be the common denominator with the defensive players in this years draft.

**Other Offseason News that Affected the Team**

Joe Mixon sure had an offseason. He had someone get shot on his property....maybe by his sister? He was arrested for threatening someone with a gun, and of course he signed a new restructured deal for less money.

This has also been the off season of the Burrow and Higgins contract. As of this writing nothing has officially happened on either fronts, but it looks like it might be getting close.

**Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Position groups:**

**QB** – Well previously I would have said this is an elite group just because Joe Burrow is leading it. I still want to believe that but I’d like to hear more about Burrows calf before I go into too much detail on how amazing this group is. Jake Browning has been getting a lot of run from the local press for looking good through the first few days of training camp. I wouldn’t be entirely shocked to see him as the eventual second string QB but for now since he has game experience I expect Trevor to remain in the second string position.

**WR/TE –** I don’t think its much of a stretch to call this the best WR room in the league. When Chase went down for an extended period last year everyone thought this team would fall back because teams would just double team Tee Higgins. Instead not only did Higgins thrive but players like Trenton Irwin stepped up out of nowhere to catch 231 yards in 9 games and only two starts. Add the guys in that were drafted this year and this is a deep deep deep WR corps.

Tight End is not as deep, but the Bengals have spent the last two years taking Tight Ends who had a lot of potential but not yet lived up to it and lifting them to new contracts. I fully expect Irv Smith to have a career year this year.

**RB** – This may be an issue. Joe Mixon had a little over 1200 yards from scrimmage last year, which is down from what this team expects from Mixon, but still a serviceable number. However, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say Chris Evans has been disappointing since he was drafted and Trayveon Williams has not had much chance to shine with only 231 yard in his career. If Chase Brown can come in and make an immediate impact in training camp he can easily take the Samaje position from last year spelling Mixon and possibly taking over as the lead back. This is going to be something to watch going forward as one of the most intriguing training camp battles.

**Offensive Line –** Boy this is going to be an interesting one this year. On Paper the OL is substantially better than it has been the last two years and that’s considering that they were SUBSTANTIALLY better last year than the year before. However, what happened? They had injuries in consecutive weeks losing 3 offensive lineman in 3 weeks. The lineup for this year looks substantially better on paper, but more than anything it looks deeper.

**Defensive Line –** Sam Hubbard, BJ Hill, Trey Hendrickson, and DJ Reader is a nightmare front for any offense. Now add first round pick Myles Murphy and Joseph Ossai into the mix and this is a very strong defensive front four. I’d put this defensive line against most defensive lines in football from a pure talent perspective. The Bengals gave up the third fewest points in the AFC last year and this line is a big part of the reason why.

**Linebacker –** Logan Wilson, Germain Pratt, and Akeem Davis Gaither are all three studs as starters, but the depth doesn’t currently look amazing. This may be one of the few positions the team is thin at. Then again its possible that Lou could work some magic with the second stringers if it comes down to it.

**Secondary –** Awuzie, Britt, Scott, and Hill are all extremely talented looking members of the secondary with a lot of question marks. Awuzie has been incredible for the Bengals but was lost last year to an injury. He just came off the PUP list a few days ago and should be ready to go for the start of the season, but is he ready? Dax Hill and Cam Taylor Britt are both second year players who showed a lot of promise towards the end of last year but you have to put a lot on their shoulders this year. Nick Scott had a nice year with the Ram last year, but this is going to be a big step for him. Last year was his first year as a starter for the Rams in a year where it was apparent really early the Rams weren’t doing much. This year he will be expected to start for a Bengals team that many are picking as Super Bowl contenders. Behind these guys Mike Hilton and Michael Thomas have showed a lot of promise and played extremely well at times and Jordan Battle will have a chance to make his case as a future starter.

**Special Teams** – Special teams is looking stronger this year than it has in a while. Kicker has not been a worry since Evan McPherson was drafted, but unfortunately Punter has been a position of weakness for the last year or two. Drue Chrisman has been okay since he took over for Kevin Huber, but he hasn’t exactly been booming kicks. The drafting of a punter this year makes it appear like the team might be looking for a substantial upgrade in punter. If Brad Robbins takes over as the punter of the future this teams special teams may be fixed for the next few years.

**Schedule Predictions**

**Week 1 – Bengals @  Browns**

Opening up with the Battle for Ohio sure is going to be a show down. This will be a test for a new look Bengals defense that is without Bates or Bell and a once again reworked Bengals OLine against Myles Garrett.  I believe the Bengals offense will overcome the Browns defense.

Final Score Bengals 27- Brown 17.

**Week 2 – Bengals Vs Ravens**

A second AFC North Match up in two weeks is honestly almost a little unfair.  Bengals Ravens has been hard nose football and last season was no exception. The Bengals lost offensive linemen in back to back Ravens games between week 18 and the wildcard round. So the Bengals will hopefully have a substantially healthier offense than the last time they played the Ravens. However the Bengals will not be playing the Pro Bowl QB Tyler Huntley and will instead be playing non Pro Bowl QB Lamar Jackson.  This will be a close tough game.

Final Score 24-17 Bengals.

**Week 3 – Bengals Vs Rams**

This could be a massive matchup for this early in the season. These two teams haven’t faced off in a meaningful game since the Super Bowl. They did however have a joint practice last year and boy howdy did it go swimmingly, as long as you ignore a massive fight that occurred at the end of the second practice that involved La’el Collins taking swings and Aaron Donald swinging Bengals helmets at people. So no theres definitely not any bad blood here.  This will be a big match up that I think the Bengals in particular will be “up for” more than any other game in the first quarter of the season.

Final Score Bengals 31 Rams 17

**Week 4 – Bengals @ Titans**

The Titans appear to be a bit of a mess right now. They don’t have a real receiving threat and its not clear if their QB of the Future is also the QB of the present. Heres what I do know for sure, The Bengals played the Titans last season without Awuzie and without Vonn Bell and still held Derrick Henry to 38 yards on 17 carries and Ryan Tannehill without a TD.  Obviously anything can happen, but this should not be a close game when its all said and done.

Final Score Bengals 24 Titans 10

**Week 5 – Bengals @ Cardinals**

I expect the Cardinals to be a substantially better team this year than last year, I do not expect this to be a competitive game. This early in the season the Cardinals should still be gelling and working to figure out their identity.

Final Score Bengals 35 Cardinals 17

**Week 6 Bengals Vs Seahawks**

The Seahawks are a very good team that on paper should have a lot of continuity from last year. The Seahawks scored a lot of points, but also gave up a lot of points. I don’t see why this would be any different.

Bengals 35 Seahawks 31

Week 7 – Bye Week

**Week 8 – Bengals @ 49ers**

This has all the makings of a trap game. I don’t think the Bengals will exactly take the 49ers lightly, but I can’t help but think that coming off of a bye week and with the Bills the next week this game could be a loss for the Bengals.  The 49ers had a very potent offense post adding CMC last year and I don’t see any reason that changes this year unless Purdy regresses. I think this will be a tough match up that the 49ers will win and once again my childhood being ruined will be brought up by the announcers.

Bengals 13 49ers 20

**Week 9 – Bengals Vs Bills**

In a rematch of last years AFC Divisional round game the Bengals and Bills play a game on a sunday night on NBC that is going to dredge up a lot of memories of Damar Hamlins horrifying injury and  an ill timed whopper commercial. This is going to be an emotional game for both teams and if the Bengals really are going to compete for the 1 seed a game they’ll have to win. The Bengals took the Bills to the wood shed in the divisional round, a loss that the Bills are going to be keen on avenging. This game could go either way, but the Burrow lead bengals havent shied away from the lights when they’ve gotten bright (unless they are playing the brown on halloween) this should be a Bengals win.

Bengals 27 Bills 19

**Week 10 – Bengals Vs Texans**

On paper this shouldn’t be close. The Texans are rolling up with a Rookie QB against a defense that has been very stout in the past and we have no reason to this it won’t be this year as well. Final Score Bengals 38 Texans 10

**Week 11 – Bengals @ Ravens**

The Bengals and Ravens are two very evenly matched teams, last year the Bengals pulled out the last two games, while the Ravens won their first meeting. All 3 games were very close. I gave the Bengals the edge in their opening matchup, but am giving the Ravens the edge here. They have an incredible secondary and I think that wins out at home.

Final Score Ravens 30 Bengals 20

**Week 12 – Bengals Vs Steelers**

This should be a big year for the team from Pittsburgh with them taking a major step forward. The second year for both Pickens and Pickett should be big steps from last year and a step towards them being substantially more competitive.  However I don’t believe that they make that big of a step forward against The Bengals and the revamped Offensive Line in Cincinnati. Final Score Bengals 27 Steelers 17

**Week 13 – Bengals @ Jaguars**

This should be a fun matchup of two very good young QBs who played very tough playoff games last year. In the end I think the Bengals have the better team and that will translate to a win. I am incredibly interested in seeing how Calvin Ridley looks on the Jags this year and think this could be a good game for him.

Final Score Bengals 27 Jaguars 23

**Week 14 – Bengals Vs Colts**

On paper again this shouldn’t be much of a fight. The Colts are a young team that’s rebuilding, however the Colts have often had the Bengals number in a way that is infuriating for a team that’s only 2 hours away. This game should not be close, but it will be.

Final score Bengals 24 Colts 17

**Week 15 – Bengals Vs Vikings**

I’m not sure what to think of this years Vikings team. Axing Dalvin Cook is just a weird look, but the Vikings have been a RB factory for the last decade constantly having very good, high end RBs so by the time week 15 rolls around I could easily see them having a very good RB corp to replace Dalvin. I really don’t have a lot of thoughts on this game other than I believe it goes the Bengals way.

Final Score Bengals 21 Vikings 13

**Week 16 –  Bengals @ Steelers**

Steelers matchups are always rough for the team from Cincinnati. While I think this game will be close in particular because its being played in Pittsburgh, similar to their first game I think this game goes the Bengals way. Final Score Bengals 24 Steelers 20

**Week 17 –  Bengals @ Chiefs**

In a repeat of the 2021 season the Bengals and Chiefs will play in the second to last game of the season. This time it occurs at KC. This game frankly is a toss up to me, much like the last 4 games against the Chiefs have been. Its going to come down to a late touchdown or field goal, but frankly could easily go either way.  I’m going to predict a final score of 30 - 23, which team wins? No idea.

**Week 18 – Bengals Vs Browns**

Once again mirroring the 2021 season the Bengals will face the Browns in the final game. As I’m predicting the Bengals will win the division this will include most of the Bengals starters being rested. Trevor Siemian will start and the Bengals will take a loss to a Browns team starting most if not all of their starters.

Browns 17 Bengals 10

**Season Predictions**

My final record prediction is 14-3 or 13-4 depending on the outcome of the Chiefs game. 2020 Bengals Fan Usidore feels like 2023 Bengals fan Usidore is being ridiculous, but this is a team that was 12-4 last year and one of those losses only came because of absolute fluke play by an emergency long snapper. They are incredibly talented and were basically a hair away from the 1 seed last year (the chiefs and Bills both had 3 losses). They have a very tough schedule ahead of them, including the gauntlet that is the AFC North. If they can come out of this with 3-4 losses this team will be among the more battle tested AFC teams in years.

Assuming they make the playoffs this is a team that should contend for the Super Bowl. Will they? Only time will tell, but I expect this team as its made up to give a run for their money to any other top teams in the AFC. If this team can somehow snag the one seed any team coming into Cincinnati will be in for a top notch atmosphere.

**Training Camp Storyline**

~~The most interesting storyline this training camp is that this is going to be Joe Burrows first real training camp. 2020 was covid, 2021 he was rehabbing from his knee injury, and 2022 he had his appendix removed. So this is going to be his first time entering the season with actual practice under his belt, which will be interesting. Last year it took Joe 4 games to get going post his appendix removal and weight loss. This year it will be interesting to see how quickly he gets up to speed. If he starts game one like he started game five last year the league is in deep trouble.~~

I have no words for this.

Obviously the new storyline for training camp and really the asterisks for everything I’ve written to this point is the health of Joe Burrow. I’ve been traveling for work this week and was in a meeting when I got the text about Burrow being carted off. The person who lead the meeting came up to me afterward and said he couldn’t figure out why I looked distraught out of the blue, then he checked his phone when the meeting ended and figured it out.

All of my predictions, ideas, hopes and dreams for this team this year are riding on Joe Burrows calf being 100% by week 1. If for some reason his current strain puts a strain on the Bengals and Trevor Siemian or Jake Browning end up starting a significant number of early games this all becomes moot and the season becomes substantially harder.

So the new training camp storyline at this point has to be how Trevor and Jake are doing and who is taking first team reps. Currently they are alternating on a day to day basis, it will be interesting to see how long that continues. Taylor has also said they will sign another QB. It will be interesting to see if they go after someone like Jameis Winston who has significant starting experience or someone more along the lines of Trevor Siemian who showed some potential but has never really started.

Either way its obvious that Bengals fans are hoping that Joes calf muscle is rested and ready to go by Week 1 against the Browns on the road.",t5_2qmg3,27076,4551,"2023 Offseason Update: Cincinnati Bengals**Cincinnati Bengals**

r/bengals

**AFC North**

**Coaching Changes**: Shockingly? None. The Bengals went into the offseason appearing like they were going to lose both OC Brian Callahan and DC Lou Anarumo to head coaching jobs. Despite both of them going deep into interviews with multiple teams both coaches were retained in Cincinnati for another year. This might be the last year that this coaching tree has all of its limbs remain intact.

**Free Agency**

**Players lost/cut**

|Player|Cut/Traded|New Team|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Jessie Bates|Contract Expired|Atlanta Falcons|
|Vonn Bell|Contract Expired|Carolina Panthers|
|Hayden Hurst|Contract Expired|Carolina Panthers|
|Tre Flowers|Contract Expired|Atlanta Falcons|

|Brandon Wilson|Contract Expired|None|
|Kevin Huber|Contract Expired|Retired|
|Tyron Johnson|Contract Expired|Dallas Cowboys|
|Eli Apple|Contract Expired|Miami Dolphins|

**Major Losses**

**Jessie Bates -** This is obviously the biggest one. Jessie was a cornerstone of the defense that took the Bengals to the Super Bowl just last year. It was relatively well known coming into this season that there was little to no chance Jessie was re-signing with the team once his franchise year was up. Jessie came into his free agency year and performed as you might expect a player who was heading for free agency to play. His overall tackles were down substantially, but he had a career high 4 interceptions and a forced fumble. Hes going to be a loss for this team.

**Vonn Bell -** A member of the Bengals 2020 free agency class Vonn Bell made an immediate impact on the team that reverberated for his entire tenure in Cincinnati. Vonn started throughout the entire Super Bowl run and was off to a roaring start last year with four interceptions and two forced fumbles through 9 games before disaster struck and he was injured. Vonn is an absolute impact player who will be missed by the defense as well.

**Samaje Perine -** Samaje is a player whos impact isnt entirely noticeable on just a cursory glance at the stats. However any further deep dive and you see how good he actually was. With only two starts Samaje amassed 394 rushing yards and 287 receiving yards. He was more than serviceable change of pace back who frankly performed at starter levels at points in the season.

**Hayden Hurst -** Another player whos numbers don't quite tell the whole story. Hurst had 414 yards in the regular season which sounds like ""mid"" tight end numbers, but Hayden was a huge part of the offense. He played in 13 games and had 19 3rd down catches on 22 targets for an average of 7.4 yards per attempt. He also averaged 9.4 yards a catch on 1st down.

**Eli Apple -** Eli was seen as a backup last year and in the end had to take a much larger role in the team. Most assumed between Mike Hilton, Cam Taylor Britt, and Awuzie that Eli would seldom see the field, and boy most were wrong. Eli started 15 games with the Bengals.

**Kevin Huber/Clark Harris -** Well this may be one of those things that people look at and say ""wow you really consider a punter and long snapper major losses?"" Yes. Clark Joined in 2008, and Kevin Joined in 2009 making both guys the last hold outs of the Palmer era.

Clark Harris came into Cincinnati and helped bring stability to a position that frankly had been god awful prior to his arrival. He joined the team and was the long snapper for almost every game from when he joined in 2008 until his unfortunate injury against the Steelers in game one of last year.

Kevin Huber likewise was joined in the Palmer era out of a positional need. He was a draft pick out of the university of Cincinnati and set the record for games played by a Bengal last year at 216.

Both of these guys were invaluable to the franchise through three eras of Bengals football and will be missed.

**Players signed**

&amp;#x200B;

|Player|Position|Signed/Re-signed|Length|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Orlando Brown Jr|LT|Signed|4 Years|
|Germaine Pratt|Linebacker|Re-Signed|3 Years|
|Nick Scott|Safety|Signed|3 Years|
|Joe Bachie|Linebacker|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Jalen Davis|Cornerback|Re-Signed|2 Years|
|Michael Thomas|Safety|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trayveon Williams|Running Back|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trent Taylor|Wide Receiver|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Cody Ford|Offensive Tackle|Signed|1 year|
|Sidney Jones|Cornerback|Signed|1 year|
|Irv Smith Jr|Tight End|Signed|1 year|
|Tarell Bashan|Outside Linebacker|Signed|1 year|
|Drew Sample|Tight End|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trevor Siemian|Quarter Back|Signed|1 year|
|Mitchell Wilcox|Tight End|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trey Hendrickson|Defensive End|Extended|1 year additional|

This is going to end up being an interesting free agency class. At face value most of the players are either re-signed or depth, however there are definitely going to be some impact players here.

**Orlando Brown Jr –** The biggest signing of the year shores up the left side of the Bengals offensive line for the next 4 years. Its no secret that the Bengals have had issues with the offensive line and have now spent two off seasons attempting to correct this. Orlando Brown Junior was arguably the best LT in free agency this year and the Bengals getting him and sliding Jonah Williams over to the right side was honestly shocking. If Orlando Brown is able to be the game changer the team thinks he is the Bengals offense should be even better.

**Germaine Pratt** – I think if you talked to most Bengals fans prior to free agency they’d have told you there was little chance that Pratt was coming back. To re-sign Pratt for 3 years is shoring up the LB position for the next 3 years and put the team into a better position to keep their defense operating at a high level.

**Nick Scott –** Nick is the immediate answer to replacing Vonn Bell, with the chance of Jordan Battle supplanting him in the future. He’s got big shoes to fill, and had a nice year in 2022 with the Rams with 86 tackles, two interceptions and two forced fumbles, not bad at all for a former 7th round pick.

**Irv Smith Jr –** This years stop on the “Bengals get a tight end a big contract with another team” train is Irv Smith Jr! Irv was drafted in the second round in 2019 by the Minnesota Vikings. He has 88 receptions for 844 yards and 9 touchdowns in his four year career. After what was done with Hayden Hurst last year I fully expect Irv to put up career highs in receptions, touchdowns, and yards, then for him to leave in free agency for 3/20.

**Draft Results**

|Round|Player|Position|School|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Myles Murphy|Edge|Clemson|
|2|DJ Turner|Cornerback|Michigan|
|3|Jordan Battle|Safety|Alabama|
|4|Charlie Jones|Wide Receiver|Purdue|
|5|Chase Brown|Running Back|Illinois|
|6|Andrei Iosivas|Wide Receiver|Princeton|
|6|Brad Robbins|Punter|Michigan|
|7|DJ Ivey|Cornerback|Miami|

I'm going to break these guys down into categories.

**Immediate Contributors:**

**Myles Murphy** \- I fully expect Murphy to have a big role this year. I don't know if he starts at all, and to an extent I don't think he does, but I expect him to get significant playing time at some point this year. One story that has come out in the offseason was from the Bengals strength coach about the fact that Murphy did 20 straight pull ups at his game weight of 280lbs then proceeded to run 20.1mph (GPS tracked).

**DJ Turner** \- With the loss of Eli Apple even with the return of Awuzie I expect second rounder DJ Turner to see significant playing time early. He reportedly ran the fastest 40 yard dash at the combine and should help improve the speed of a group that often felt like it got burned when Apple was targeted.

**Brad Robbins** \- As I mentioned previously the Bengals parted ways with Kevin Huber who has in turn retired. Drue Chrisman took over as the Punter for the Bengals and was serviceable but not what I would call elite. You don't invest a draft pick in a punter unless you think they have real talent. The Bengals have a training camp battle with Chrisman and Robbins for the punter of the future, if Robbins wins out he will be an immediate contributor this year.

**Possible Contributors this year:**

**Jordan Battle** \- With the addition of Nick Scott Battle doesn't have to be an immediate starter and that may be good. It will allow him to ease into the league. Battle has been quiet for the most part this off season but alabama fans rave about him. He could force his way into the starting line up if things fall his way.

**Chase Brown** \- The restructured deal for Mixon means the Bengals aren't necessarily looking for a new lead back right now. When Brown has talked to reporters hes talked about working on his run blocking more than anything else with pass catching short behind it. It sounds like theres a good chance he has already been told to plan on being a 3rd down back early on. If he has a role similar to Perine this year his impact could be massive.

**Maybe next year:**

**Charlie Jones and Andrei Iosivas** \- I wish the best for both of these guys, but honestly I don't understand these picks. No one reading this was muttering ""Wow the bengals need more Wide Receivers"" yet here we are. With Boyd, Chase, and Higgins as well as Mixon, Irv Smith, Trenton Irwin, and Trent Taylor I just don't see these guys getting much of a shot this year. I could be wrong, and if one of them breaks out it might make it easier for the team to move on from Boyd in the off season.

**DJ Ivey** \- I don't expect much this year out of Ivey with Turner drafted ahead of him, however hes gotten praise from CB coach Chuck Burks as being able to play the position ""at a high level"" and has been praised for his 4.46 speed. Speed really seems to be the common denominator with the defensive players in this years draft.

**Other Offseason News that Affected the Team**

Joe Mixon sure had an offseason. He had someone get shot on his property....maybe by his sister? He was arrested for threatening someone with a gun, and of course he signed a new restructured deal for less money.

This has also been the off season of the Burrow and Higgins contract. As of this writing nothing has officially happened on either fronts, but it looks like it might be getting close.

Projected Roster

|Quarterback|Joe Burrow|Trevor Siemian|Jake Browning|
|Runningback|Joe Mixon|Chase Brown|Trayveon Williams/Chris Evans|

**Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Position groups:**

**QB** – Well previously I would have said this is an elite group just because Joe Burrow is leading it. I still want to believe that but I’d like to hear more about Burrows calf before I go into too much detail on how amazing this group is. Jake Browning has been getting a lot of run from the local press for looking good through the first few days of training camp. I wouldn’t be entirely shocked to see him as the eventual second string QB but for now since he has game experience I expect Trevor to remain in the second string position.

**WR/TE –** I don’t think its much of a stretch to call this the best WR room in the league. When Chase went down for an extended period last year everyone thought this team would fall back because teams would just double team Tee Higgins. Instead not only did Higgins thrive but players like Trenton Irwin stepped up out of nowhere to catch 231 yards in 9 games and only two starts. Add the guys in that were drafted this year and this is a deep deep deep WR corps.

Tight End is not as deep, but the Bengals have spent the last two years taking Tight Ends who had a lot of potential but not yet lived up to it and lifting them to new contracts. I fully expect Irv Smith to have a career year this year.

**RB** – This may be an issue. Joe Mixon had a little over 1200 yards from scrimmage last year, which is down from what this team expects from Mixon, but still a serviceable number. However, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say Chris Evans has been disappointing since he was drafted and Trayveon Williams has not had much chance to shine with only 231 yard in his career. If Chase Brown can come in and make an immediate impact in training camp he can easily take the Samaje position from last year spelling Mixon and possibly taking over as the lead back. This is going to be something to watch going forward as one of the most intriguing training camp battles.

**Offensive Line –** Boy this is going to be an interesting one this year. On Paper the OL is substantially better than it has been the last two years and that’s considering that they were SUBSTANTIALLY better last year than the year before. However, what happened? They had injuries in consecutive weeks losing 3 offensive lineman in 3 weeks. The lineup for this year looks substantially better on paper, but more than anything it looks deeper.

**Defensive Line –** Sam Hubbard, BJ Hill, Trey Hendrickson, and DJ Reader is a nightmare front for any offense. Now add first round pick Myles Murphy and Joseph Ossai into the mix and this is a very strong defensive front four. I’d put this defensive line against most defensive lines in football from a pure talent perspective. The Bengals gave up the third fewest points in the AFC last year and this line is a big part of the reason why.

**Linebacker –** Logan Wilson, Germain Pratt, and Akeem Davis Gaither are all three studs as starters, but the depth doesn’t currently look amazing. This may be one of the few positions the team is thin at. Then again its possible that Lou could work some magic with the second stringers if it comes down to it.

**Secondary –** Awuzie, Britt, Scott, and Hill are all extremely talented looking members of the secondary with a lot of question marks. Awuzie has been incredible for the Bengals but was lost last year to an injury. He just came off the PUP list a few days ago and should be ready to go for the start of the season, but is he ready? Dax Hill and Cam Taylor Britt are both second year players who showed a lot of promise towards the end of last year but you have to put a lot on their shoulders this year. Nick Scott had a nice year with the Ram last year, but this is going to be a big step for him. Last year was his first year as a starter for the Rams in a year where it was apparent really early the Rams weren’t doing much. This year he will be expected to start for a Bengals team that many are picking as Super Bowl contenders. Behind these guys Mike Hilton and Michael Thomas have showed a lot of promise and played extremely well at times and Jordan Battle will have a chance to make his case as a future starter.

**Special Teams** – Special teams is looking stronger this year than it has in a while. Kicker has not been a worry since Evan McPherson was drafted, but unfortunately Punter has been a position of weakness for the last year or two. Drue Chrisman has been okay since he took over for Kevin Huber, but he hasn’t exactly been booming kicks. The drafting of a punter this year makes it appear like the team might be looking for a substantial upgrade in punter. If Brad Robbins takes over as the punter of the future this teams special teams may be fixed for the next few years.

**Schedule Predictions**

**Week 1 – Bengals @  Browns**

Opening up with the Battle for Ohio sure is going to be a show down. This will be a test for a new look Bengals defense that is without Bates or Bell and a once again reworked Bengals OLine against Myles Garrett.  I believe the Bengals offense will overcome the Browns defense.

Final Score Bengals 27- Brown 17.

**Week 2 – Bengals Vs Ravens**

A second AFC North Match up in two weeks is honestly almost a little unfair.  Bengals Ravens has been hard nose football and last season was no exception. The Bengals lost offensive linemen in back to back Ravens games between week 18 and the wildcard round. So the Bengals will hopefully have a substantially healthier offense than the last time they played the Ravens. However the Bengals will not be playing the Pro Bowl QB Tyler Huntley and will instead be playing non Pro Bowl QB Lamar Jackson.  This will be a close tough game.

Final Score 24-17 Bengals.

**Week 3 – Bengals Vs Rams**

This could be a massive matchup for this early in the season. These two teams haven’t faced off in a meaningful game since the Super Bowl. They did however have a joint practice last year and boy howdy did it go swimmingly, as long as you ignore a massive fight that occurred at the end of the second practice that involved La’el Collins taking swings and Aaron Donald swinging Bengals helmets at people. So no theres definitely not any bad blood here.  This will be a big match up that I think the Bengals in particular will be “up for” more than any other game in the first quarter of the season.

Final Score Bengals 31 Rams 17

**Week 4 – Bengals @ Titans**

The Titans appear to be a bit of a mess right now. They don’t have a real receiving threat and its not clear if their QB of the Future is also the QB of the present. Heres what I do know for sure, The Bengals played the Titans last season without Awuzie and without Vonn Bell and still held Derrick Henry to 38 yards on 17 carries and Ryan Tannehill without a TD.  Obviously anything can happen, but this should not be a close game when its all said and done.

Final Score Bengals 24 Titans 10

**Week 5 – Bengals @ Cardinals**

I expect the Cardinals to be a substantially better team this year than last year, I do not expect this to be a competitive game. This early in the season the Cardinals should still be gelling and working to figure out their identity.

Final Score Bengals 35 Cardinals 17

**Week 6 Bengals Vs Seahawks**

The Seahawks are a very good team that on paper should have a lot of continuity from last year. The Seahawks scored a lot of points, but also gave up a lot of points. I don’t see why this would be any different.

Bengals 35 Seahawks 31

Week 7 – Bye Week

**Week 8 – Bengals @ 49ers**

This has all the makings of a trap game. I don’t think the Bengals will exactly take the 49ers lightly, but I can’t help but think that coming off of a bye week and with the Bills the next week this game could be a loss for the Bengals.  The 49ers had a very potent offense post adding CMC last year and I don’t see any reason that changes this year unless Purdy regresses. I think this will be a tough match up that the 49ers will win and once again my childhood being ruined will be brought up by the announcers.

Bengals 13 49ers 20

**Week 9 – Bengals Vs Bills**

In a rematch of last years AFC Divisional round game the Bengals and Bills play a game on a sunday night on NBC that is going to dredge up a lot of memories of Damar Hamlins horrifying injury and  an ill timed whopper commercial. This is going to be an emotional game for both teams and if the Bengals really are going to compete for the 1 seed a game they’ll have to win. The Bengals took the Bills to the wood shed in the divisional round, a loss that the Bills are going to be keen on avenging. This game could go either way, but the Burrow lead bengals havent shied away from the lights when they’ve gotten bright (unless they are playing the brown on halloween) this should be a Bengals win.

Bengals 27 Bills 19

**Week 10 – Bengals Vs Texans**

On paper this shouldn’t be close. The Texans are rolling up with a Rookie QB against a defense that has been very stout in the past and we have no reason to this it won’t be this year as well. Final Score Bengals 38 Texans 10

**Week 11 – Bengals @ Ravens**

The Bengals and Ravens are two very evenly matched teams, last year the Bengals pulled out the last two games, while the Ravens won their first meeting. All 3 games were very close. I gave the Bengals the edge in their opening matchup, but am giving the Ravens the edge here. They have an incredible secondary and I think that wins out at home.

Final Score Ravens 30 Bengals 20

**Week 12 – Bengals Vs Steelers**

This should be a big year for the team from Pittsburgh with them taking a major step forward. The second year for both Pickens and Pickett should be big steps from last year and a step towards them being substantially more competitive.  However I don’t believe that they make that big of a step forward against The Bengals and the revamped Offensive Line in Cincinnati. Final Score Bengals 27 Steelers 17

**Week 13 – Bengals @ Jaguars**

This should be a fun matchup of two very good young QBs who played very tough playoff games last year. In the end I think the Bengals have the better team and that will translate to a win. I am incredibly interested in seeing how Calvin Ridley looks on the Jags this year and think this could be a good game for him.

Final Score Bengals 27 Jaguars 23

**Week 14 – Bengals Vs Colts**

On paper again this shouldn’t be much of a fight. The Colts are a young team that’s rebuilding, however the Colts have often had the Bengals number in a way that is infuriating for a team that’s only 2 hours away. This game should not be close, but it will be.

Final score Bengals 24 Colts 17

**Week 15 – Bengals Vs Vikings**

I’m not sure what to think of this years Vikings team. Axing Dalvin Cook is just a weird look, but the Vikings have been a RB factory for the last decade constantly having very good, high end RBs so by the time week 15 rolls around I could easily see them having a very good RB corp to replace Dalvin. I really don’t have a lot of thoughts on this game other than I believe it goes the Bengals way.

Final Score Bengals 21 Vikings 13

**Week 16 –  Bengals @ Steelers**

Steelers matchups are always rough for the team from Cincinnati. While I think this game will be close in particular because its being played in Pittsburgh, similar to their first game I think this game goes the Bengals way. Final Score Bengals 24 Steelers 20

**Week 17 –  Bengals @ Chiefs**

In a repeat of the 2021 season the Bengals and Chiefs will play in the second to last game of the season. This time it occurs at KC. This game frankly is a toss up to me, much like the last 4 games against the Chiefs have been. Its going to come down to a late touchdown or field goal, but frankly could easily go either way.  I’m going to predict a final score of 30 - 23, which team wins? No idea.

**Week 18 – Bengals Vs Browns**

Once again mirroring the 2021 season the Bengals will face the Browns in the final game. As I’m predicting the Bengals will win the division this will include most of the Bengals starters being rested. Trevor Siemian will start and the Bengals will take a loss to a Browns team starting most if not all of their starters.

Browns 17 Bengals 10

**Season Predictions**

My final record prediction is 14-3 or 13-4 depending on the outcome of the Chiefs game. 2020 Bengals Fan Usidore feels like 2023 Bengals fan Usidore is being ridiculous, but this is a team that was 12-4 last year and one of those losses only came because of absolute fluke play by an emergency long snapper. They are incredibly talented and were basically a hair away from the 1 seed last year (the chiefs and Bills both had 3 losses). They have a very tough schedule ahead of them, including the gauntlet that is the AFC North. If they can come out of this with 3-4 losses this team will be among the more battle tested AFC teams in years.

Assuming they make the playoffs this is a team that should contend for the Super Bowl. Will they? Only time will tell, but I expect this team as its made up to give a run for their money to any other top teams in the AFC. If this team can somehow snag the one seed any team coming into Cincinnati will be in for a top notch atmosphere.

**Training Camp Storyline**

~~The most interesting storyline this training camp is that this is going to be Joe Burrows first real training camp. 2020 was covid, 2021 he was rehabbing from his knee injury, and 2022 he had his appendix removed. So this is going to be his first time entering the season with actual practice under his belt, which will be interesting. Last year it took Joe 4 games to get going post his appendix removal and weight loss. This year it will be interesting to see how quickly he gets up to speed. If he starts game one like he started game five last year the league is in deep trouble.~~

I have no words for this.

Obviously the new storyline for training camp and really the asterisks for everything I’ve written to this point is the health of Joe Burrow. I’ve been traveling for work this week and was in a meeting when I got the text about Burrow being carted off. The person who lead the meeting came up to me afterward and said he couldn’t figure out why I looked distraught out of the blue, then he checked his phone when the meeting ended and figured it out.

All of my predictions, ideas, hopes and dreams for this team this year are riding on Joe Burrows calf being 100% by week 1. If for some reason his current strain puts a strain on the Bengals and Trevor Siemian or Jake Browning end up starting a significant number of early games this all becomes moot and the season becomes substantially harder.

So the new training camp storyline at this point has to be how Trevor and Jake are doing and who is taking first team reps. Currently they are alternating on a day to day basis, it will be interesting to see how long that continues. Taylor has also said they will sign another QB. It will be interesting to see if they go after someone like Jameis Winston who has significant starting experience or someone more along the lines of Trevor Siemian who showed some potential but has never really started.

Either way its obvious that Bengals fans are hoping that Joes calf muscle is rested and ready to go by Week 1 against the Browns on the road."

Any where the black line is above the blue line the positional tag has increased as a % of the cap and where it is lower it has decreased as a % of the cap.

"Looking back, Should the Colts have kept Peyton Manning and built a team around him instead of drafting Andrew Luck?",nfl,"The argument for both sides of this discussion can definitely be had, I personally have always been under the side of keeping Peyton Manning even with his injury issues. I am not a Colts fan but a Texans fan and damn I wanted Peyton Manning so bad when he was a free agent. Regardless He went to the Broncos and went to two superbowls while winning one. The last one wasn’t off his back but regardless he had some pretty nice seasons in Denver. I think he definitely could have had the same type of success if not more had the Colts kept him. 
Now Andrew Luck is no slouch and probably did as best as a QB could have with the expectations he had since day one. He never had a solid O-Line so maybe Peyton Manning wouldn’t have lasted as long with the Colts as he did with the Broncos. Luck was definitely sensational when he played! He turned the 2-14 Colts around in a season! He definitely was worth taking the mantle from Peyton. He was very injury prone though although I definitely blame a good chunk of his injury issues on the Colts. As many times as he got them to the playoffs he never got them to a Superbowl where Peyton Manning got them there twice, once if you discount the 2nd one and regardless of the giant age gap, they only retired 3 years apart from eachother. Overall I think keeping Manning in the long run would have been better for the Colts. What do you think?",t5_2qmg3,1384,263,"Looking back, Should the Colts have kept Peyton Manning and built a team around him instead of drafting Andrew Luck?The argument for both sides of this discussion can definitely be had, I personally have always been under the side of keeping Peyton Manning even with his injury issues. I am not a Colts fan but a Texans fan and damn I wanted Peyton Manning so bad when he was a free agent. Regardless He went to the Broncos and went to two superbowls while winning one. The last one wasn’t off his back but regardless he had some pretty nice seasons in Denver. I think he definitely could have had the same type of success if not more had the Colts kept him. 
Now Andrew Luck is no slouch and probably did as best as a QB could have with the expectations he had since day one. He never had a solid O-Line so maybe Peyton Manning wouldn’t have lasted as long with the Colts as he did with the Broncos. Luck was definitely sensational when he played! He turned the 2-14 Colts around in a season! He definitely was worth taking the mantle from Peyton. He was very injury prone though although I definitely blame a good chunk of his injury issues on the Colts.

"Most receiving yards in first 10 seasons, only 5 cracked 12k yards. Julio is the only one to have 90+ YPG over that period, with 95.5.",nfl,"Just something else to prove that Julio was the best WR in the 2010s and easily among one of the greatest ever. 

- Rice - 13,275 yards, 820 rec, 156 games, 85.1 YPG

- Julio - 12,896 yards, 848 rec, 135 games, 95.5 YPG

- Holt - 12,660 yards, 869 rec, 158 games, 80.1 YPG

- Harrison - 12,331 yards, 927 rec, 154 games, 80.1 YPG

- Moss - 12,193 yards, 774 rec, 154 games, 79.2 YPG

Had Megatron played his 10th season, he, too, would've made the 12k cut. Thru 9 seasons he had 11,619 yards, 731 recs, 135 games, 86.1 YPG 

As for AB, he needed some help, so if you ignore his first year where he wasn't a starter (167 yards receiving), and then also ignore his 2019 season where he played 1 game, you get - 12,068 yards, 908 rec, 136 games, 88.7 YPG

Out of curiosity I went thru everyone else to see if they had a 10 year stretch where they cracked 12k yards, where you omit a season or two where they weren't starting, but none showed up. Many came close tho.

I could go on with more examples, but you get the point

**My take:**

Russell Wilson from 2012-2020 was obviously a VERY GOOD QB. No one argues that. But looking back on him career in Seattle, I do wonder how he ever got the perception of being the ""Best"" or ""being elite/top 3"".

From 2012-2014, I think everyone would agree Aaron Rodgers, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady were better. So he is out the top 3 there. Obviously Manning declined and retired, but I still think Rodgers and Brady were considered better from 2015-2020. This isn't even factoring in Brees, Rivers or Matt Ryan, who you could argue for

And looking at Russ statistically, he rarely had the ""ELITE"" numbers. I'm just going to start from 2015 cause before that Russ was Very low volume. He had great passer ratings but he threw the ball 20 times a game and wasn't asked to really sling it.

* 2015 Russ actually led NFL in passer rating. Top 5 in EPA so that was his best year
* 2016 Russ took a step back. Not top 5 in Rating, EPA or ANY/A
* 2017 he led in TD passes, partially due to injuries but he did carry Seahawks with little support. However, his rate stats weren't amazing. I don't think he was top 3 here
* 2018 he had great TD/INT but only had 3440 yards. Mahomes, Brees and Rivers were better imo. I would also argue Luck was a little better
* 2019 Wilson was considered an MVP candidate, but he was 7th in ANY/A. Lamar obviously won MVP and honestly even Mahomes on a 14 game sample was better. ANY/A, EPA etc
* 2020 he began to decline, having a very top heavy year. First 8 weeks he was great but average after
* Then of course injured in 2021 and we know what happened in 2022
* The Seahawks were top 5 in points scored ONCE with Russ. Even the year he was an ""MVP"" candidate, they were 13th in YPD and 11th in PPD.

Russell Wilson to me was always very good without being truly elite. Many teams would have loved to have him, but I do find it strange that he garnered a perception of being elite when he never really was

2023 Off Season Review Series: Los Angeles Chargers,nfl,"# Los Angeles Chargers

10-7 2022 Record  |  2nd in AFC West  |  Lost 30-31 @ Jacksonville in the Wild Card matchup

**Redemption**

This team has to prove they belong in the top tier of AFC teams in this era. They have the talent, and they have the coaching staff. They have keep guys on the field, and close out games that are sure wins. Ever since drafting Justin, its been this team needing one more piece. Going into this season it looks like all the pieces are in place. Sure they may have some weaknesses along the line, might not be deep at running back, linebacker or safety. They have key pieces in the right places to go far this season. This team should do well even in a tough conference. If not the pressure will be on Staley, who has received outside criticism during his tenure as head coach.

# Coaching Changes

**Incoming coaches**

|Coach|Position|
|:-|:-|
|Kellen Moore|Offensive Coordinator|
|Doug Nussmeier|QB coach/ Passing game coordinator|
|Derrick Ansley|Defensive Coordinator|
|Jeff Howard|Linebackers Coach|
|Tom Donatell|Secondary Coach|
|Will Harris|Assistant Secondary Coach|
|Robert Muschamp|Defensive Quality Control coach|
|Sal Lopez|Head Athletic Trainer|
|Marco Zucconi|Director of Player Health and Performance|

Kellen Moore is the huge addition, Lombardi had to go. People may say Lombardi was used a sacrifice for Staley to keep his job, but with this offense you have to get results and it just seemed like something was missing. The hitch route became to common last year, the ball needs to get in the air. This team has to get Keenan and Mike to challenge the top and middle of the field. Quentin will be an amazing player for Herbert to get the ball out quick if this offensive line has injury concerns. Also Ansley gets promoted after Hill is let go, this is also a shuffle that needed to happen. Shake the stink of last years disappointment of and come back with guys that are hungry. Also a new head athletics trainer, Damon Mitchell had been with the team since 2001 and had been the head trainer for 6 years.

# Free Agency

**Players lost/cut**

|Joe Gaziano|DE|Atlanta|
|Forrest Merrill|DE|Seattle|
|Storm Norton|OT|New Orleans|
|Derrek Tuszka|DE|Minnesota|

Losses Like Adderley, Van Noy and Tranquill hurt, they have tried to replace or upgrade at those positions. We shall see how those changes turn out.  Chase Daniel not being brought back, and replaced with younger guys should be fine as long as Justin stays healthy. Covington being let go after being injured is how it goes, he was a decent stop gap on the interior but it just never came together. Sad to see DeAndre Carter go, but hopefully they wont have to go that deep into the depth chart this year.

|Kemon Hall|CB|***RFA***|1|.940|
|Donald Parham Jr.|TE|***RFA***|2|2.65|
|Foster Sarell|OT|***RFA***|1|.705|

This is a huge year for Herbert, just signed an thru 2029. Chargers needed to lock him down, and doing so before Burrow probably is for the best. Re-signing Pipkins and Fox hold key spots for mid level talent, but they will have to prove they are worth the money. Kendricks brought in to shore up the tackling, hopefully making the defense more effective at all levels. CJ Okoye will be a project, not expecting anything right now. He could be a potential replacement for Mack down the line. Guyton and Parham will be key rotation guys on offense they have real skill and are hopefully going to get a few chances to prove just how good they can be.

# Draft

|Round|Pick Number|Player|Position|School|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|21|Quentin Johnston|WR|TCU|
|2|54|Tuli Tuipulotu|OLB|USC|
|3|85|Daiyan Henley|ILB|Washington State|
|4|125|Derius Davis|WR|TCU|
|5|156|Jordan McFadden|T|Clemson|
|6|200|Scott Matlock|DT|Boise State|
|7|239|Max Duggan|QB|TCU|

This draft is all about making sure they got depth where they may need it should an injury occur. There is a possibility Henley getting looks at starter, it just depends on the coverage they use and how Kenneth Murray Jr. does this season. Tuli will be useful as a pass rusher but with Bosa and Mack he is definitely a back up. Then the group from TCU, Davis will get some looks at receiver but mostly serve as a returner. Max will start the season as the third string QB, he's got time to grow into a decent backup and reliable guy in the room, but the big name is Quentin Johnston. The 21st pick will be placed in a group of talented wide receivers, some say they should have picked a speedster or maybe another position that was more needed. Quentin Johnston has had a good start to camp and will look to silence the critics.

&amp;#x200B;

*Other Offseason News that Affected the Team*

Staley replacing some of his coordinators was a huge move and will have to return results quickly. If he doesn't build wins early in the season he will be on the hot seat. I have him winning 3 out of 4 heading in to the bye week, Miami, Tennessee and Minnesota will be key games in getting of to a good start this season. Joey Bosa has to be on the field, he's a key difference maker, and hopefully the new athletic trainer will be the answer to the injury bug that bit this team last season. After a trade request and a bit of unrest this offseason, Austin Ekeler getting 2M in incentives will shift his focus to meeting those incentives and figuring out a long term solution after the season.

Key Players:

***Justin Herbert***

***Austin Ekeler***

***Keenan Allen***

***Rashawn Slater***

***Joey Bosa***

***Derwin James***

***J.C. Jackson***

I'm highlighting these guys, but instead of talking about them individually, I'll say this. These guys have proven they are stars/superstars, they are all impact players that are incredible. They also improve the players they play with. Above all else they have to stay healthy, or at least the majority of these guys. J.C. being ready for the season is not only miraculous, but also very important for getting the other DBs ready at the position they expect to spend most of the season. Surely I could add Linsley, Mack or Kendricks to this group, they are also incredible players themselves. Three proven veterans that will all be able to significantly impact games, but the first group needs to be the difference makers.

# Position Group Summary

*Position groups:*

* *QB -* Top of the league talent. Certainly a cannon for an arm, and he needs to let it fly this year.
* *Backfield -* Ekeler and the boys will hope to be better than last year running the ball.
* *OL -* Hopefully a healthy line will give better results in the run game, and give Justin time to throw.
* *Pass catchers -* a talented group that needs to get the ball at every level of the field.
* *DL -* strong at the edges but they will have to be good up front and stop the run.
* *LB -* Kendricks will have to prove that he is the answer. If he can be a solid tackler, that solves a lot of problems
* *Secondary -* A group with a lot of promise, we may see 5 or 6 DBs on the field a lot this season.
* *Special Teams -* Gonna have to hit some clutch field goals if the games stay close. New returners may be shakey and have some fumbles early on.

# Key Games

**Miami** has to be a tough game. A home opener but looking just at the offensive fire power, we shall see what the defense is made of. Disguising coverages, holding back the big passing plays have been the key points for Staley. I think they battle it out, close game, but a defeat.

As for **Las Vegas**, both games will be very important, both teams have high hopes. I have to think the Raiders are in over their head again this year. The matchup of Crosby and Slater if both are healthy will be the one to watch. I'm picking two wins but its the AFC west, going 4-2 is going to be a huge point of pride.

This is a huge year for **Dallas**. This will be the Kellen Moore game, he is going to be out to prove a point. Both teams are looking for deep playoff runs, and honestly it could be a win. I'm going to mark it as a loss, if Pollard is in and healthy, we know the run defense is a huge struggle. Until they can prove they are able to stop the run, I'm hesitant to give them the edge.

**Kansas City**, it goes without saying, they are the top of the conference, let alone the division. If the Chargers can pick a game off them it would be huge. Really interested to see how this defense tries to stop Mahomes. Going to be two tough games, but if the Chiefs dominate early throughout the season then the week 18 matchup might be an easy win.

With the **Jets**, it comes down to 1 thing is Aaron Rodgers still at the top of his game. If he is hurt or even out this defense has a good chance of completely stopping any movement by this offense. A huge Monday night win in week 9 would be a great way to set the table for the second half of the season.

**Denver**, we really don't know what's going to happen here. I am very low on the Broncos, I don't think Payton and Wilson will mesh. They have a really solid defense, but on offense they couldn't stop turning over the ball. They committed the 7th most turnovers last year. If that continues, the Chargers defense should dominate those games.

A late December matchup with **Buffalo** will be a great game, and it being at home gives this team a chance. Buffalo has had some crazy weather games in the last few seasons, but that should be the case in LA. Josh Allen coming off an injury that didn't require surgery could be something to watch, especially for a QB who plays as physical as him. I have the Bills roster being one of the best from top to bottom in the AFC. This could be a game of who has a healthier team, or who wants to save some guys for the postseason. Regardless the Bills are always a tough opponent and this will most likely end in a loss.

# Summary

Overall I have the team going somewhere similar to last year, right around 10-7. If the injury bug bites this team again, I don't know if they manage the record they had last year with this schedule. Obviously the last 2 quarters of last season can't happen again. As with any team it comes down to minimizing mistakes, and being in control of the game. They could make a run on the playoffs, but obviously looking at the road through the AFC, it will NOT be easy. This team could take a game off a lot of the top teams. Of course in my game picks, I picked them to lose a lot of the tough matchups. I think a lot of those will be close and honestly could go either way. Ill predict a 31-27 loss to the Chiefs in the AFC conference Championship.",t5_2qmg3,13461,1983,"2023 Off Season Review Series: Los Angeles Chargers# Los Angeles Chargers

This is a huge year for Herbert, just signed an thru 2029. Chargers needed to lock him down, and doing so before Burrow probably is for the best. Re-signing Pipkins and Fox hold key spots for mid level talent, but they will have to prove they are worth the money. Kendricks brought in to shore up the tackling, hopefully making the defense more effective at all levels. CJ Okoye will be a project, not expecting anything right now. He could be a potential replacement for Mack down the line. Guyton and Parham will be key rotation guys on offense they have real skill and are hopefully going to get a few chances to prove just how good they can be.

# Draft

|Round|Pick Number|Player|Position|School|

|5|156|Jordan McFadden|T|Clemson|
|6|200|Scott Matlock|DT|Boise State|
|7|239|Max Duggan|QB|TCU|

This draft is all about making sure they got depth where they may need it should an injury occur. There is a possibility Henley getting looks at starter, it just depends on the coverage they use and how Kenneth Murray Jr. does this season. Tuli will be useful as a pass rusher but with Bosa and Mack he is definitely a back up. Then the group from TCU, Davis will get some looks at receiver but mostly serve as a returner. Max will start the season as the third string QB, he's got time to grow into a decent backup and reliable guy in the room, but the big name is Quentin Johnston. The 21st pick will be placed in a group of talented wide receivers, some say they should have picked a speedster or maybe another position that was more needed. Quentin Johnston has had a good start to camp and will look to silence the critics.

&amp;#x200B;

*Other Offseason News that Affected the Team*

Staley replacing some of his coordinators was a huge move and will have to return results quickly. If he doesn't build wins early in the season he will be on the hot seat. I have him winning 3 out of 4 heading in to the bye week, Miami, Tennessee and Minnesota will be key games in getting of to a good start this season. Joey Bosa has to be on the field, he's a key difference maker, and hopefully the new athletic trainer will be the answer to the injury bug that bit this team last season. After a trade request and a bit of unrest this offseason, Austin Ekeler getting 2M in incentives will shift his focus to meeting those incentives and figuring out a long term solution after the season.

Key Players:

***Justin Herbert***

***Austin Ekeler***

***Keenan Allen***

***Rashawn Slater***

***Joey Bosa***

***Derwin James***

***J.C. Jackson***

I'm highlighting these guys, but instead of talking about them individually, I'll say this. These guys have proven they are stars/superstars, they are all impact players that are incredible. They also improve the players they play with. Above all else they have to stay healthy, or at least the majority of these guys. J.C. being ready for the season is not only miraculous, but also very important for getting the other DBs ready at the position they expect to spend most of the season. Surely I could add Linsley, Mack or Kendricks to this group, they are also incredible players themselves. Three proven veterans that will all be able to significantly impact games, but the first group needs to be the difference makers.

# Position Group Summary

*Position groups:*

* *QB -* Top of the league talent. Certainly a cannon for an arm, and he needs to let it fly this year.
* *Backfield -* Ekeler and the boys will hope to be better than last year running the ball.
* *OL -* Hopefully a healthy line will give better results in the run game, and give Justin time to throw.
* *Pass catchers -* a talented group that needs to get the ball at every level of the field.
* *DL -* strong at the edges but they will have to be good up front and stop the run.
* *LB -* Kendricks will have to prove that he is the answer. If he can be a solid tackler, that solves a lot of problems
* *Secondary -* A group with a lot of promise, we may see 5 or 6 DBs on the field a lot this season.
* *Special Teams -* Gonna have to hit some clutch field goals if the games stay close. New returners may be shakey and have some fumbles early on.

# Key Games

**Miami** has to be a tough game. A home opener but looking just at the offensive fire power, we shall see what the defense is made of. Disguising coverages, holding back the big passing plays have been the key points for Staley. I think they battle it out, close game, but a defeat.

As for **Las Vegas**, both games will be very important, both teams have high hopes. I have to think the Raiders are in over their head again this year. The matchup of Crosby and Slater if both are healthy will be the one to watch. I'm picking two wins but its the AFC west, going 4-2 is going to be a huge point of pride.

This is a huge year for **Dallas**. This will be the Kellen Moore game, he is going to be out to prove a point. Both teams are looking for deep playoff runs, and honestly it could be a win. I'm going to mark it as a loss, if Pollard is in and healthy, we know the run defense is a huge struggle. Until they can prove they are able to stop the run, I'm hesitant to give them the edge.

**Kansas City**, it goes without saying, they are the top of the conference, let alone the division. If the Chargers can pick a game off them it would be huge. Really interested to see how this defense tries to stop Mahomes. Going to be two tough games, but if the Chiefs dominate early throughout the season then the week 18 matchup might be an easy win.

With the **Jets**, it comes down to 1 thing is Aaron Rodgers still at the top of his game. If he is hurt or even out this defense has a good chance of completely stopping any movement by this offense. A huge Monday night win in week 9 would be a great way to set the table for the second half of the season.

**Denver**, we really don't know what's going to happen here. I am very low on the Broncos, I don't think Payton and Wilson will mesh. They have a really solid defense, but on offense they couldn't stop turning over the ball. They committed the 7th most turnovers last year. If that continues, the Chargers defense should dominate those games.

A late December matchup with **Buffalo** will be a great game, and it being at home gives this team a chance. Buffalo has had some crazy weather games in the last few seasons, but that should be the case in LA. Josh Allen coming off an injury that didn't require surgery could be something to watch, especially for a QB who plays as physical as him. I have the Bills roster being one of the best from top to bottom in the AFC. This could be a game of who has a healthier team, or who wants to save some guys for the postseason. Regardless the Bills are always a tough opponent and this will most likely end in a loss.

# Summary

Overall I have the team going somewhere similar to last year, right around 10-7. If the injury bug bites this team again, I don't know if they manage the record they had last year with this schedule. Obviously the last 2 quarters of last season can't happen again. As with any team it comes down to minimizing mistakes, and being in control of the game. They could make a run on the playoffs, but obviously looking at the road through the AFC, it will NOT be easy. This team could take a game off a lot of the top teams. Of course in my game picks, I picked them to lose a lot of the tough matchups. I think a lot of those will be close and honestly could go either way. Ill predict a 31-27 loss to the Chiefs in the AFC conference Championship."

2023 Offseason Review: Baltimore Ravens,nfl,"**Team: Baltimore Ravens**

Division: AFC North

Subreddit: [r/ravens](https://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/)

2022-23 Regular Season Record: 10-7, 5-3 Home and 5-4 Away, 2nd Place in the AFC North

Postseason: 6th seed, lost to Bengals in Wildcard Round

**Introduction:**

Hello Ravens Flock! Welcome to your 2023 offseason review! I am not a Ravens fan myself (I have the misfortune of being a Bears fan and have no connection to the Ravens or the Baltimore area), so expect a hopefully fair and unbiased examination at the moves the Ravens made this offseason and how this new season looks to be shaping up.

All in all, the 2022-23 season for the Baltimore Ravens was not too bad. Improving from a record of 8-9 the previous season, the team’s 10-7 record was enough to earn a spot in the wildcard round. While the Ravens suffered a first-round exit to their division rivals, the team put up a pretty good fight and had the misfortune of being on the wrong side of a historic fumble return touchdown. The majority of the Raven’s key pieces are returning this year, and combined with some new additions, this team looks to be a serious contender in the AFC once again.

For the past couple years, a crucial problem for the Ravens has been injuries. Key offensive players like Lamar Jackson, J.K. Dobbins, and Rashod Bateman all missed significant time in the 2022-23 season, and the team lost 3 out of their last 4 games, sliding from 9-4 and the 3rd seed in the AFC to 10-7 and the 6th seed. As the new season approaches, hopes of the Ravens making a serious playoff run and having a potential shot at the Super Bowl certainly ride on maintaining the health of their stars.

**Coaching Changes:**

It will be John Harbaugh’s 16th season at the helm, as he looks to bring another Super Bowl to Charm City. Underneath him, though, there have been some changes in leadership.

**Todd Monken - Offensive Coordinator**

The Baltimore Ravens parted ways with their former offensive coordinator Greg Roman in January and hired Todd Monken around a month later. Monken was formerly the offensive coordinator of the University of Georgia, where he helped the Bulldogs win two national championships. Before that, Monken was with the Browns in 2019 (during Odell Beckham Jr.’s most recent 1000-yard receiving season!), the Buccaneers from 2016-18, and head coach of Southern Mississippi from 2013-15. His background is mostly in the receiving room, marking a fresh change from his predecessor’s run-heavy playstyle. For a team that only managed 3040 total passing yards last season (28th in the league), this new hire will ideally open up the passing game and create new opportunities for Lamar Jackson and his receivers to move the ball downfield and score touchdowns. My grade: **A**

**Tee Martin - Quarterbacks Coach**

Promoted from his role as wide receivers coach with the Ravens, Martin has been with the team already for 2 years. Beforehand, he had roles with University of Tennessee, USC, and Kentucky. He replaced quarterbacks coach James Urban. Under Martin’s wide receivers coaching tenure, he didn’t have a lot of superstar talent to work with, and his receivers often struggled to even stay on the field due to injuries. He lacks professional quarterback-coaching experience at the NFL level, but his experience with the Ravens so far has evidently meant that they believe he is ready for the task. My grade: **B**

**Willie Taggart - Running Backs Coach**

His first season at the NFL level, Taggart has previously held roles as head coach of Florida State, Oregon, and most recently Florida Atlantic University from 2020-22. Under his helm, FAU was ranked 38th in rushing yards per game with 184.3 yards. His overall experience at the college level has been mixed, with FAU firing him after an overtime loss to his alma mater, Western Kentucky, in 2022. Before that, he led Florida State to their first losing season in 40 years, then was fired before the end of the next season. Despite this, Harbaugh has confidence in Taggart’s abilities. Hopefully, he is able to lead the Ravens running backs to success this upcoming season. My grade: **C-**

**Greg Lewis - Wide Receivers Coach**

Lewis replaces Tee Martin as wide receivers coach. Before, he was coach of the Chiefs’ running backs and wide receivers from 2017-22. The Chiefs have had significant success during that time, and Lewis will ideally bring that success with him to Baltimore. Over the years, Lewis has guided the development of players like Tyreek Hill, Isiah Pacheco, Mecole Hardman, Brandin Cooks, and Tyler Boyd. He will look to provide that same mentoring to young receivers like Zay Flowers in the Ravens receiving room. My grade: **A**

**Chuck Smith - Outside Linebackers Coach**

Smith was a 2nd-team All-Pro pass rusher with the Falcons in the 1990s, and he once even had a 5-sack game (one of only 19 players to ever do so). He has not coached in the NFL, however, since a pass-rush specialist stint in 2009 with the Jets. The majority of his coaching experience has been as a private pass-rush trainer, where his trainees have included Aaron Donald and Carlos Dunlap. Replacing Rob Leonard, Smith will look to build on the 48 team sacks recorded last season (5th in the NFL). My grade: **B+**

**Dennard Wilson - Defensive Backs Coach**

Wilson helped coach the Eagles’ defensive backs in 2021 and 2022, working with players like Darius Slay, and James Bradberry. Before that, he worked with the defensive backs room on the Jets from 2017-2020. The strength of the Eagles’ secondary in the past two years gives Wilson credibility as he enters a defensive backfield that gave up 229.4 passing yards per game (23rd in the league) and caught 14 interceptions (16th in the league). My grade: **A-**

**Scott Elliott - Strength and Conditioning Coordinator**

The previous strength and conditioning coordinator, Steve Saunders, was a controversial figure for both fans and Ravens players. He was criticized for the team’s high number of injuries by players like Matthew Judon, Derek Wolfe, and Rashod Bateman. Scott Elliott’s promotion to head strength and conditioning coordinator will hopefully mark a new era of fewer injuries, allowing the Ravens to succeed in the later stretch of the season and into the postseason. Before his tenure with the Ravens started in 2018, Elliott ran a training performance facility in Kansas. Elliott must focus on injury prevention and recovery in his new role. My grade: **A-**

**Major Departures:**

**Calais Campbell**: Campbell has been around the league for a while—he’s actually the oldest active defensive lineman in the NFL at 36 years old. He signed with the Ravens in 2020 and has been a solid veteran player on the line, recording 5.5 sacks and 2 forced fumbles in 2022. Unfortunately, though, Campbell was a casualty of the Lamar Jackson payday, and was sacrificed for $7 million in freed cap space. On the Ravens, Campbell was a solid piece of the defense. His veteran presence and good sportsmanship (he won the 2019 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award) will be welcome in Atlanta.

**Ben Powers**: Powers had a breakout season in 2022, notching elite pass block and run block win rates. When it came time for free agency, the Broncos offered him $52 million for 4 years, $28.5 million of the total sum guaranteed. This price was evidently incompatible with a new Lamar Jackson contract and other signings. Whether Powers can continue to perform at a high level is now Denver’s problem. But losing Powers will be a sting to the capabilities of the Ravens’ offensive line.

**Marcus Peters**: A three-time Pro Bowler, Peters has 32 career interceptions—but only one of those came from 2022. Last season was a clear down year after a season-ending ACL injury in 2021. The Raiders have been in need of cornerback improvement, and they signed Peters for that role, hoping he can return to Pro Bowl form. As for the Ravens, the impact of a loss of a veteran pass defender will have to be determined during this upcoming season.

**Major Signings:**

**Lamar Jackson:** The road to re-signing was a rocky one for Lamar Jackson. He first tweeted that he asked for a trade, but received a notably lackluster amount of interest from other teams. Perhaps it was the MVP-winning quarterback’s unprecedented price tag—a record-setting $52 million per year deal ended up happening, including $185 million total guaranteed.Or his history of injuries, as he has missed the end of the last 2 seasons due to various sprains. Jackson does not have an agent and represented himself throughout the dealings, which also may have contributed to some of the chaos throughout contract negotiations. After all is said and done, though, Lamar Jackson will now be making the most money of any player in the NFL, and not a cent will be going to any unnecessary middlemen.

Will the dealings have fractured the connection between Jackson and the Ravens front office? Only time will tell. Is the new deal going to bring Jackson back to his fully-healthy 2019 MVP form? Again, we will have to see. What will Jackson do with all of his new money? Likely upgrade from his paltry $1.3 million mansion and meager Rolls-Royce into something half-decent.

All in all, this deal cements Jackson as the man the Ravens have put their faith in to lead them to victory. Expectations are high. Whether Jackson can stay healthy and prove that he was a worthwhile investment will be key to this upcoming season. My grade: **A-**

**Odell Beckham Jr.:** The Ravens’ 2022 wide receiving corps was headlined by the likes of mostly-injured-Rashod Bateman, Demarcus Robinson, and Devin Duvernay. Beckham Jr. is an instant boost to this receiving room. A 3-time Pro Bowler from 2014-2016, Beckham Jr. has struggled with injuries, and at 30, his time in the NFL may be catching up to him. At the same time, though, Beckham’s athleticism and skills are undeniable when healthy. Pairing him with Lamar Jackson will bring out the best in both of them. My grade: **A-**

**Rock Ya-Sin:** Rock Ya-Sin is 26 years old and has had decent seasons with the Colts and most recently the Raiders. He will compete for and is expected to win the starting outside cornerback slot opposite Marlon Humphrey. After the Ravens did not select a cornerback until the 5th round of the draft, Ya-Sin will likely be a competent but not especially amazing piece of a secondary that needs more depth, especially after the loss of Marcus Peters. My grade: **B**

**Draft:**

|Round|Number|Player|Position|School|

:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|

|1|22|Zay Flowers|WR|Boston College|

|3|86|Trenton Simpson|ILB|Clemson|

|4|124|Tavius Robinson|OLB|Ole Miss|

|5|157|Kyu Blu Kelly|CB|Stanford|

|6|199|Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu|OT|Oregon|

|7|229|Andrew Vorhees|OG|USC|

**Zay Flowers:** Zay Flowers is an explosive, speedy receiver who will likely start in the slot for Baltimore. At Boston College, he was a quick and savvy route runner who racked up high yards after catch too. Flowers’ weakness is that he is undersized and may lack the size to come up with 50-50 or deep balls. He also struggled a bit with drops in college. Flowers’ best usage in the Ravens offense is probably running short or medium crossing routes that get him in the middle of the field where he can use his speed and field vision. This Ravens offense needed explosiveness in the receiving room, and Flowers will instantly provide that, even if he lacks the catching capabilities of other receivers. My grade: **A**

**Trenton Simpson:** Coming into the draft, Trenton Simpson was one of the top-ranked inside linebackers and a definite steal in the third round. However, the Ravens already have a top young inside-linebacker corps with Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen. Notably, the Ravens did decline Patrick Queen’s fifth-year option, so Simpson could be stepping into the starting spot sooner than many may think. At Clemson, Simpson has had experience lining up as an outside linebacker and even a cornerback. He has excellent man-coverage ability and run-defense capabilities, but still may lack the polished technical skills needed for tackling at the Pro-Bowl level. Although this pick was certainly high-value in the third round, it’s unclear what Simpson’s role will be in Baltimore. My grade: **B**

**Tavius Robinson:** Baltimore’s edge rushing has been a point of turnover in the past years—their two projected starters have a combined 3 years of NFL experience, and it appears that veterans Justin Houston and Jason Pierre-Paul have no sign of returning to the Ravens next year. Tavius Robinson is a flashy and physical pass-rusher with excellent athleticism and a lot of potential. He will likely begin his NFL career as a rotational player for the Raven’s pass-rushing team. My grade: **A-**

**Kyu Blu Kelly:** Kyu Blu Kelly not only has a cool name, but a family history of NFL success, as his father Brian was a cornerback for the Buccaneers when they won their first Super Bowl. Last season the cornerback depth behind star Marlon Humphrey was a weakness, and Kelly is a physical and quick cornerback who excels in press coverage situations. However, Kelly is still rough around the edges in zone coverage and as a tackler. He has a lot of potential and will hopefully rise to the occasion for the Ravens. My grade: **A-**

**Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu:** Like many other late-round offensive line prospects, Aumavae-Laula has excellent physical tools but unrefined technique. He will provide depth to an already-adept Ravens offensive line and could develop his skills to gain a starting job later in the future. My grade: **B**

**Andrew Vorhees:** Andrew Vorhees tore his ACL at the NFL combine, essentially ruling him out for the 2023 season, but the Ravens still traded a 2024 6th-round draft pick to the Cleveland Browns to move up and select him. Vorhees is probably what you think of when imaging the physicality of an NFL lineman: strong, powerful, and aggressive. He actually benched the most reps at the combine even after tearing his ACL. This pick was low-risk, high-potential, and while Vorhees won’t be on the field this season, he may play a big role in the future of the Ravens’ O-Line. My grade: **A**

**Position Groups:**

**Quarterbacks:** Lamar Jackson, when healthy, is a top quarterback in the NFL. His MVP-winning season was a demonstration of his abilities in the air and on the ground, and with a new contract signed, perhaps he can return to that form for the entirety of a season (and postseason). However, the last couple of years have been marred by injury, both to Jackson and his supporting cast. Speaking of supporting cast, Jackson’s receiving room last year also did not provide him much support in the throwing game. This season, with new weapons, will be a test for Jackson. Can he stay healthy? Can he lead his team to the playoffs and beyond? Behind him, Tyler Huntley has the distinction of technically being a Pro Bowl QB. His play was solid, but not particularly exceptional, during last season. If Jackson has to sit out a game or two, then Huntley is a capable substitute. However, leaving him at the reins for the majority of a season/playoff push is questionable. My position group grade: **A-**

**Backfield:** J.K. Dobbins is an effective running back when healthy, but persistent injury problems were an issue in 2022. Like much of the rest of this Ravens offense, staying injury-free is a priority for him. Gus Edwards also had a solid 2022 season as a second-string running back but probably won’t turn into a superstar in 2023. Behind the two of them, Justice Hill and Melvin Gordon will vie for snaps and both will serve as decent backups. Fullback Patrick Ricard was selected to the Pro Bowl for the fourth year in a row in 2022, and serves his role well as a gadget-guy able to block, run, and receive. Not to mention, while Lamar Jackson is not officially part of the running back room, his skills on the ground are a huge part of the Raven’s rushing attack. Overall, this backfield has good depth and can be very effective if Dobbins stays healthy, but that might be a big *if*. My grade: **B**

**Receivers:** Last year, the Ravens were bottom-five in receiving yards, and the wide receivers were an especially weak point. Over the offseason, though, the Ravens have made some promising moves, namely signing Odell Beckham Jr. and drafting Zay Flowers. Rashod Bateman also had a promising beginning to the season before missing the majority of 2022 with a foot injury. It will—and I know it is starting to sound like a broken record at this point—all come down to injury. Beckham Jr. has dealt with his own share of injury troubles outside of the Ravens organization and there is no guarantee that Bateman will be able to replicate his flaming-hot start of last season. As for Flowers, all indications point to success in training camp and beyond, but the Ravens have yet to ever draft a Pro Bowl receiver. Can Flowers break the curse? Beyond those three, the starting receivers for much of last season will now become the backups, a role where they will probably be more relatively effective. Toss in Mark Andrews and this group instantly goes up a notch. Isaiah Likely also proved to be a good second option at tight end. My grade: **B+**

**Offensive Line:** While lacking a singular superstar lineman or 2022 Pro Bowler, the Ravens offensive line is altogether a top unit in the NFL. Last season, it proved to be incredibly efficient in the run-blocking and pass-blocking game. Of course, it doesn’t hurt the sack rate when the elusive Lamar Jackson is under center, but still this line has excellent players like Ronnie Stanley, Morgan Moses, Kevin Zeitler, and 2022 All-Rookie center Tyler Lindenbaum. As long as this unit can stay mostly healthy, they should once again be amongst the best in the league. My grade: **A**

**Defensive Line:** Last year, the Ravens defense was top-three against the run and had 48 sacks. However, this could be more attributed to the strength of the teams’ linebackers as well as the defensive scheme and coaching. Michael Pierce’s nose tackle position is able to force double teams and allow for fellow defensive ends Justin Madubuike or Broderick Washington to apply pressure. On paper, this squad doesn’t seem like the most formidable, but if they were effective in 2022, why not in 2023? My grade: **B-**

**Linebackers:** The aforementioned Ravens defense’s effectiveness was primarily due to the powerful duo of Pro Bowler Roquan Smith, who was traded from Chicago to Baltimore in the middle of the 2022 season, and Patrick Queen. Adding rookie Trenton Simpson could add even more depth and athleticism. Odafe Oweh and David Ojabo have not proven much yet, but both are still young and could breakout into edge-rushing talents. Roquan Smith is a proficient tackler and playmaker, and Patrick Queen is also a very reliable tackler. This linebacker corps is certainly top-of-the-league and could be a big factor in the success of the 2023 season. My grade: **A**

**Defensive Backs:** Pro Bowler Marlon Humphrey had a strong season in 2022 with 3 interceptions and the top man coverage grade among cornerbacks. Opposite him, there is a notable lack of depth at corner, however. Rock Ya-Sin will have to replace Marcus Peters, and Kyu Blu Kelly could shine as a rookie. The safeties in Baltimore are a highlight of the whole team. Kyle Hamilton was top-ranked at safety, and although he primarily played in the slot in 2022, his move to strong safety for next season looks very promising. At free safety, Marcus Williams is a great ballhawk with excellent physical traits. This secondary did struggle against the passing game in the 2022 season, allowing the 23rd-most passing yards per game. However, as Kyle Hamilton grows and if a rookie or young player can break out, this could easily become a top unit in the league and have the stats to show for it. My grade: **A-**

**Special Teams:** J-Tuck, Legatron, Justin Tuck-GOAT. . . whatever you want to call him, he’s still the best kicker in the NFL. An incredibly valuable and reliable part of the team, Tucker has often singlehandedly willed his team to victory through his mastery of the art of the field goal. As for punting, while Jordan Stout is still young, he does have a bottom-tier average punt distance. On the other side of special teams, Pro Bowl kick retuner Devin Duvernay scored a kick return touchdown last season and, as long as he stays healthy, threatens to do so again this year. My grade: **A**

**Schedule Prediction:**

Preseason: Three more wins to extend the streak to 26!

Regular Season:

|16|@ 49ers|LOSE|10-5|

|17|vs. Dolphins|WIN|11-5|

|18|vs. Steelers|LOSE|11-6|

Explanations:

1. Ravens are 10-2 vs. Texans all time, have a better roster, and are at home.
2. Joe Burrow has never lost at home against the Ravens, and the Bengals are good.
3. The Colts’s strength in running will be neutralized, and their passing attack is questionable
4. Lamar Jackson has won 5 of his last 6 games against the Browns.
5. But he has lost 3 out of his last 4 games against the Steelers.
6. Is the Ravens-Titans rivalry really legit? Also, this is a London game!
7. Baltimore has never lost a home game to Detroit.
8. I predict at this point in the season the Cardinals will already have created their Caleb Williams’ uniform.
9. The Seahawks have an excellent pass offense and defense.
10. Cleveland hasn’t won a game in Baltimore since 2019
11. Home game, playoff revenge against the Bengals. . . who knows?
12. The two most injury-riddled teams square off. Last time, the Ravens dominated in Los Angeles. 
13. A late bye week is a trend towards Super Bowl success.
14. The city of Los Angeles is no match for a post-bye-week Ravens squad.
15. Fun fact: in the 90s, the Jaguars went 8-0 against the Ravens.
16. Remember when the lights went out at the Super Bowl? Good times.
17. In 3 games from 2016-19, the Ravens beat the Dolphins by a combined score of 137-16
18. Sorry Ravens Flock. But I feel like it will be that 8-8 point in the season for Mike Tomlin and he will sell his soul to the devil for another non-losing season.

Final Record: 11-6, 7-2 at home, 4-4 on the road

Postseason: After a predicted record of 11-6, the Ravens would earn a wildcard spot in the playoffs. I predict them to finish second in the AFC North behind the Bengals. As for the playoffs, I think that if the Ravens are still healthy enough by the end of 18 weeks,  the Super Bowl is not at all out of the question. Realistically, though, I foresee this team losing in either the wildcard or divisional round. But Baltimore is certainly a contender in every game they will play this year, and they have the roster to go all the way.",t5_2qmg3,26859,4014,"2023 Offseason Review: Baltimore Ravens**Team: Baltimore Ravens**

Division: AFC North

Subreddit: [r/ravens](https://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/)

2022-23 Regular Season Record: 10-7, 5-3 Home and 5-4 Away, 2nd Place in the AFC North

Postseason: 6th seed, lost to Bengals in Wildcard Round

**Introduction:**

Hello Ravens Flock! Welcome to your 2023 offseason review! I am not a Ravens fan myself (I have the misfortune of being a Bears fan and have no connection to the Ravens or the Baltimore area), so expect a hopefully fair and unbiased examination at the moves the Ravens made this offseason and how this new season looks to be shaping up.

All in all, the 2022-23 season for the Baltimore Ravens was not too bad. Improving from a record of 8-9 the previous season, the team’s 10-7 record was enough to earn a spot in the wildcard round. While the Ravens suffered a first-round exit to their division rivals, the team put up a pretty good fight and had the misfortune of being on the wrong side of a historic fumble return touchdown. The majority of the Raven’s key pieces are returning this year, and combined with some new additions, this team looks to be a serious contender in the AFC once again.

For the past couple years, a crucial problem for the Ravens has been injuries. Key offensive players like Lamar Jackson, J.K. Dobbins, and Rashod Bateman all missed significant time in the 2022-23 season, and the team lost 3 out of their last 4 games, sliding from 9-4 and the 3rd seed in the AFC to 10-7 and the 6th seed. As the new season approaches, hopes of the Ravens making a serious playoff run and having a potential shot at the Super Bowl certainly ride on maintaining the health of their stars.

**Coaching Changes:**

It will be John Harbaugh’s 16th season at the helm, as he looks to bring another Super Bowl to Charm City. Underneath him, though, there have been some changes in leadership.

**Todd Monken - Offensive Coordinator**

The Baltimore Ravens parted ways with their former offensive coordinator Greg Roman in January and hired Todd Monken around a month later. Monken was formerly the offensive coordinator of the University of Georgia, where he helped the Bulldogs win two national championships. Before that, Monken was with the Browns in 2019 (during Odell Beckham Jr.’s most recent 1000-yard receiving season!), the Buccaneers from 2016-18, and head coach of Southern Mississippi from 2013-15. His background is mostly in the receiving room, marking a fresh change from his predecessor’s run-heavy playstyle. For a team that only managed 3040 total passing yards last season (28th in the league), this new hire will ideally open up the passing game and create new opportunities for Lamar Jackson and his receivers to move the ball downfield and score touchdowns. My grade: **A**

**Tee Martin - Quarterbacks Coach**

Promoted from his role as wide receivers coach with the Ravens, Martin has been with the team already for 2 years. Beforehand, he had roles with University of Tennessee, USC, and Kentucky. He replaced quarterbacks coach James Urban. Under Martin’s wide receivers coaching tenure, he didn’t have a lot of superstar talent to work with, and his receivers often struggled to even stay on the field due to injuries. He lacks professional quarterback-coaching experience at the NFL level, but his experience with the Ravens so far has evidently meant that they believe he is ready for the task. My grade: **B**

**Willie Taggart - Running Backs Coach**

His first season at the NFL level, Taggart has previously held roles as head coach of Florida State, Oregon, and most recently Florida Atlantic University from 2020-22. Under his helm, FAU was ranked 38th in rushing yards per game with 184.3 yards. His overall experience at the college level has been mixed, with FAU firing him after an overtime loss to his alma mater, Western Kentucky, in 2022. Before that, he led Florida State to their first losing season in 40 years, then was fired before the end of the next season. Despite this, Harbaugh has confidence in Taggart’s abilities. Hopefully, he is able to lead the Ravens running backs to success this upcoming season. My grade: **C-**

**Greg Lewis - Wide Receivers Coach**

Lewis replaces Tee Martin as wide receivers coach. Before, he was coach of the Chiefs’ running backs and wide receivers from 2017-22. The Chiefs have had significant success during that time, and Lewis will ideally bring that success with him to Baltimore. Over the years, Lewis has guided the development of players like Tyreek Hill, Isiah Pacheco, Mecole Hardman, Brandin Cooks, and Tyler Boyd. He will look to provide that same mentoring to young receivers like Zay Flowers in the Ravens receiving room. My grade: **A**

**Chuck Smith - Outside Linebackers Coach**

Smith was a 2nd-team All-Pro pass rusher with the Falcons in the 1990s, and he once even had a 5-sack game (one of only 19 players to ever do so). He has not coached in the NFL, however, since a pass-rush specialist stint in 2009 with the Jets. The majority of his coaching experience has been as a private pass-rush trainer, where his trainees have included Aaron Donald and Carlos Dunlap. Replacing Rob Leonard, Smith will look to build on the 48 team sacks recorded last season (5th in the NFL). My grade: **B+**

**Dennard Wilson - Defensive Backs Coach**

Wilson helped coach the Eagles’ defensive backs in 2021 and 2022, working with players like Darius Slay, and James Bradberry. Before that, he worked with the defensive backs room on the Jets from 2017-2020. The strength of the Eagles’ secondary in the past two years gives Wilson credibility as he enters a defensive backfield that gave up 229.4 passing yards per game (23rd in the league) and caught 14 interceptions (16th in the league). My grade: **A-**

**Scott Elliott - Strength and Conditioning Coordinator**

The previous strength and conditioning coordinator, Steve Saunders, was a controversial figure for both fans and Ravens players. He was criticized for the team’s high number of injuries by players like Matthew Judon, Derek Wolfe, and Rashod Bateman. Scott Elliott’s promotion to head strength and conditioning coordinator will hopefully mark a new era of fewer injuries, allowing the Ravens to succeed in the later stretch of the season and into the postseason. Before his tenure with the Ravens started in 2018, Elliott ran a training performance facility in Kansas. Elliott must focus on injury prevention and recovery in his new role. My grade: **A-**

**Major Departures:**

**Calais Campbell**: Campbell has been around the league for a while—he’s actually the oldest active defensive lineman in the NFL at 36 years old. He signed with the Ravens in 2020 and has been a solid veteran player on the line, recording 5.5 sacks and 2 forced fumbles in 2022. Unfortunately, though, Campbell was a casualty of the Lamar Jackson payday, and was sacrificed for $7 million in freed cap space. On the Ravens, Campbell was a solid piece of the defense. His veteran presence and good sportsmanship (he won the 2019 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award) will be welcome in Atlanta.

**Ben Powers**: Powers had a breakout season in 2022, notching elite pass block and run block win rates. When it came time for free agency, the Broncos offered him $52 million for 4 years, $28.5 million of the total sum guaranteed. This price was evidently incompatible with a new Lamar Jackson contract and other signings. Whether Powers can continue to perform at a high level is now Denver’s problem. But losing Powers will be a sting to the capabilities of the Ravens’ offensive line.

**Marcus Peters**: A three-time Pro Bowler, Peters has 32 career interceptions—but only one of those came from 2022. Last season was a clear down year after a season-ending ACL injury in 2021. The Raiders have been in need of cornerback improvement, and they signed Peters for that role, hoping he can return to Pro Bowl form. As for the Ravens, the impact of a loss of a veteran pass defender will have to be determined during this upcoming season.

**Major Signings:**

**Lamar Jackson:** The road to re-signing was a rocky one for Lamar Jackson. He first tweeted that he asked for a trade, but received a notably lackluster amount of interest from other teams. Perhaps it was the MVP-winning quarterback’s unprecedented price tag—a record-setting $52 million per year deal ended up happening, including $185 million total guaranteed.Or his history of injuries, as he has missed the end of the last 2 seasons due to various sprains. Jackson does not have an agent and represented himself throughout the dealings, which also may have contributed to some of the chaos throughout contract negotiations. After all is said and done, though, Lamar Jackson will now be making the most money of any player in the NFL, and not a cent will be going to any unnecessary middlemen.

Will the dealings have fractured the connection between Jackson and the Ravens front office? Only time will tell. Is the new deal going to bring Jackson back to his fully-healthy 2019 MVP form? Again, we will have to see. What will Jackson do with all of his new money? Likely upgrade from his paltry $1.3 million mansion and meager Rolls-Royce into something half-decent.

All in all, this deal cements Jackson as the man the Ravens have put their faith in to lead them to victory. Expectations are high. Whether Jackson can stay healthy and prove that he was a worthwhile investment will be key to this upcoming season. My grade: **A-**

**Odell Beckham Jr.:** The Ravens’ 2022 wide receiving corps was headlined by the likes of mostly-injured-Rashod Bateman, Demarcus Robinson, and Devin Duvernay. Beckham Jr. is an instant boost to this receiving room. A 3-time Pro Bowler from 2014-2016, Beckham Jr. has struggled with injuries, and at 30, his time in the NFL may be catching up to him. At the same time, though, Beckham’s athleticism and skills are undeniable when healthy. Pairing him with Lamar Jackson will bring out the best in both of them. My grade: **A-**

**Rock Ya-Sin:** Rock Ya-Sin is 26 years old and has had decent seasons with the Colts and most recently the Raiders. He will compete for and is expected to win the starting outside cornerback slot opposite Marlon Humphrey. After the Ravens did not select a cornerback until the 5th round of the draft, Ya-Sin will likely be a competent but not especially amazing piece of a secondary that needs more depth, especially after the loss of Marcus Peters. My grade: **B**

**Draft:**

|Round|Number|Player|Position|School|

:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|

|1|22|Zay Flowers|WR|Boston College|

|3|86|Trenton Simpson|ILB|Clemson|

|4|124|Tavius Robinson|OLB|Ole Miss|

|5|157|Kyu Blu Kelly|CB|Stanford|

|6|199|Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu|OT|Oregon|

|7|229|Andrew Vorhees|OG|USC|

**Zay Flowers:** Zay Flowers is an explosive, speedy receiver who will likely start in the slot for Baltimore. At Boston College, he was a quick and savvy route runner who racked up high yards after catch too. Flowers’ weakness is that he is undersized and may lack the size to come up with 50-50 or deep balls. He also struggled a bit with drops in college. Flowers’ best usage in the Ravens offense is probably running short or medium crossing routes that get him in the middle of the field where he can use his speed and field vision. This Ravens offense needed explosiveness in the receiving room, and Flowers will instantly provide that, even if he lacks the catching capabilities of other receivers. My grade: **A**

**Trenton Simpson:** Coming into the draft, Trenton Simpson was one of the top-ranked inside linebackers and a definite steal in the third round. However, the Ravens already have a top young inside-linebacker corps with Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen. Notably, the Ravens did decline Patrick Queen’s fifth-year option, so Simpson could be stepping into the starting spot sooner than many may think. At Clemson, Simpson has had experience lining up as an outside linebacker and even a cornerback. He has excellent man-coverage ability and run-defense capabilities, but still may lack the polished technical skills needed for tackling at the Pro-Bowl level. Although this pick was certainly high-value in the third round, it’s unclear what Simpson’s role will be in Baltimore. My grade: **B**

**Tavius Robinson:** Baltimore’s edge rushing has been a point of turnover in the past years—their two projected starters have a combined 3 years of NFL experience, and it appears that veterans Justin Houston and Jason Pierre-Paul have no sign of returning to the Ravens next year. Tavius Robinson is a flashy and physical pass-rusher with excellent athleticism and a lot of potential. He will likely begin his NFL career as a rotational player for the Raven’s pass-rushing team. My grade: **A-**

**Kyu Blu Kelly:** Kyu Blu Kelly not only has a cool name, but a family history of NFL success, as his father Brian was a cornerback for the Buccaneers when they won their first Super Bowl. Last season the cornerback depth behind star Marlon Humphrey was a weakness, and Kelly is a physical and quick cornerback who excels in press coverage situations. However, Kelly is still rough around the edges in zone coverage and as a tackler. He has a lot of potential and will hopefully rise to the occasion for the Ravens. My grade: **A-**

**Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu:** Like many other late-round offensive line prospects, Aumavae-Laula has excellent physical tools but unrefined technique. He will provide depth to an already-adept Ravens offensive line and could develop his skills to gain a starting job later in the future. My grade: **B**

**Andrew Vorhees:** Andrew Vorhees tore his ACL at the NFL combine, essentially ruling him out for the 2023 season, but the Ravens still traded a 2024 6th-round draft pick to the Cleveland Browns to move up and select him. Vorhees is probably what you think of when imaging the physicality of an NFL lineman: strong, powerful, and aggressive. He actually benched the most reps at the combine even after tearing his ACL. This pick was low-risk, high-potential, and while Vorhees won’t be on the field this season, he may play a big role in the future of the Ravens’ O-Line. My grade: **A**

**Position Groups:**

**Quarterbacks:** Lamar Jackson, when healthy, is a top quarterback in the NFL. His MVP-winning season was a demonstration of his abilities in the air and on the ground, and with a new contract signed, perhaps he can return to that form for the entirety of a season (and postseason). However, the last couple of years have been marred by injury, both to Jackson and his supporting cast. Speaking of supporting cast, Jackson’s receiving room last year also did not provide him much support in the throwing game. This season, with new weapons, will be a test for Jackson. Can he stay healthy? Can he lead his team to the playoffs and beyond? Behind him, Tyler Huntley has the distinction of technically being a Pro Bowl QB. His play was solid, but not particularly exceptional, during last season. If Jackson has to sit out a game or two, then Huntley is a capable substitute. However, leaving him at the reins for the majority of a season/playoff push is questionable. My position group grade: **A-**

**Backfield:** J.K. Dobbins is an effective running back when healthy, but persistent injury problems were an issue in 2022. Like much of the rest of this Ravens offense, staying injury-free is a priority for him. Gus Edwards also had a solid 2022 season as a second-string running back but probably won’t turn into a superstar in 2023. Behind the two of them, Justice Hill and Melvin Gordon will vie for snaps and both will serve as decent backups. Fullback Patrick Ricard was selected to the Pro Bowl for the fourth year in a row in 2022, and serves his role well as a gadget-guy able to block, run, and receive. Not to mention, while Lamar Jackson is not officially part of the running back room, his skills on the ground are a huge part of the Raven’s rushing attack. Overall, this backfield has good depth and can be very effective if Dobbins stays healthy, but that might be a big *if*. My grade: **B**

**Receivers:** Last year, the Ravens were bottom-five in receiving yards, and the wide receivers were an especially weak point. Over the offseason, though, the Ravens have made some promising moves, namely signing Odell Beckham Jr. and drafting Zay Flowers. Rashod Bateman also had a promising beginning to the season before missing the majority of 2022 with a foot injury. It will—and I know it is starting to sound like a broken record at this point—all come down to injury. Beckham Jr. has dealt with his own share of injury troubles outside of the Ravens organization and there is no guarantee that Bateman will be able to replicate his flaming-hot start of last season. As for Flowers, all indications point to success in training camp and beyond, but the Ravens have yet to ever draft a Pro Bowl receiver. Can Flowers break the curse? Beyond those three, the starting receivers for much of last season will now become the backups, a role where they will probably be more relatively effective. Toss in Mark Andrews and this group instantly goes up a notch. Isaiah Likely also proved to be a good second option at tight end. My grade: **B+**

**Offensive Line:** While lacking a singular superstar lineman or 2022 Pro Bowler, the Ravens offensive line is altogether a top unit in the NFL. Last season, it proved to be incredibly efficient in the run-blocking and pass-blocking game. Of course, it doesn’t hurt the sack rate when the elusive Lamar Jackson is under center, but still this line has excellent players like Ronnie Stanley, Morgan Moses, Kevin Zeitler, and 2022 All-Rookie center Tyler Lindenbaum. As long as this unit can stay mostly healthy, they should once again be amongst the best in the league. My grade: **A**

**Defensive Line:** Last year, the Ravens defense was top-three against the run and had 48 sacks. However, this could be more attributed to the strength of the teams’ linebackers as well as the defensive scheme and coaching. Michael Pierce’s nose tackle position is able to force double teams and allow for fellow defensive ends Justin Madubuike or Broderick Washington to apply pressure. On paper, this squad doesn’t seem like the most formidable, but if they were effective in 2022, why not in 2023? My grade: **B-**

**Linebackers:** The aforementioned Ravens defense’s effectiveness was primarily due to the powerful duo of Pro Bowler Roquan Smith, who was traded from Chicago to Baltimore in the middle of the 2022 season, and Patrick Queen. Adding rookie Trenton Simpson could add even more depth and athleticism. Odafe Oweh and David Ojabo have not proven much yet, but both are still young and could breakout into edge-rushing talents. Roquan Smith is a proficient tackler and playmaker, and Patrick Queen is also a very reliable tackler. This linebacker corps is certainly top-of-the-league and could be a big factor in the success of the 2023 season. My grade: **A**

**Defensive Backs:** Pro Bowler Marlon Humphrey had a strong season in 2022 with 3 interceptions and the top man coverage grade among cornerbacks. Opposite him, there is a notable lack of depth at corner, however. Rock Ya-Sin will have to replace Marcus Peters, and Kyu Blu Kelly could shine as a rookie. The safeties in Baltimore are a highlight of the whole team. Kyle Hamilton was top-ranked at safety, and although he primarily played in the slot in 2022, his move to strong safety for next season looks very promising. At free safety, Marcus Williams is a great ballhawk with excellent physical traits. This secondary did struggle against the passing game in the 2022 season, allowing the 23rd-most passing yards per game. However, as Kyle Hamilton grows and if a rookie or young player can break out, this could easily become a top unit in the league and have the stats to show for it. My grade: **A-**

**Special Teams:** J-Tuck, Legatron, Justin Tuck-GOAT. . . whatever you want to call him, he’s still the best kicker in the NFL. An incredibly valuable and reliable part of the team, Tucker has often singlehandedly willed his team to victory through his mastery of the art of the field goal. As for punting, while Jordan Stout is still young, he does have a bottom-tier average punt distance. On the other side of special teams, Pro Bowl kick retuner Devin Duvernay scored a kick return touchdown last season and, as long as he stays healthy, threatens to do so again this year. My grade: **A**

**Schedule Prediction:**

Preseason: Three more wins to extend the streak to 26!

Regular Season: 

|Week|Opponent|Result|Record|

|16|@ 49ers|LOSE|10-5|

|17|vs. Dolphins|WIN|11-5|

|18|vs. Steelers|LOSE|11-6|

Explanations:

1. Ravens are 10-2 vs. Texans all time, have a better roster, and are at home.
2. Joe Burrow has never lost at home against the Ravens, and the Bengals are good.
3. The Colts’s strength in running will be neutralized, and their passing attack is questionable
4. Lamar Jackson has won 5 of his last 6 games against the Browns.
5. But he has lost 3 out of his last 4 games against the Steelers.
6. Is the Ravens-Titans rivalry really legit? Also, this is a London game!
7. Baltimore has never lost a home game to Detroit.
8. I predict at this point in the season the Cardinals will already have created their Caleb Williams’ uniform.
9. The Seahawks have an excellent pass offense and defense.
10. Cleveland hasn’t won a game in Baltimore since 2019
11. Home game, playoff revenge against the Bengals. . . who knows?
12. The two most injury-riddled teams square off. Last time, the Ravens dominated in Los Angeles. 
13. A late bye week is a trend towards Super Bowl success.
14. The city of Los Angeles is no match for a post-bye-week Ravens squad.
15. Fun fact: in the 90s, the Jaguars went 8-0 against the Ravens.
16. Remember when the lights went out at the Super Bowl? Good times.
17. In 3 games from 2016-19, the Ravens beat the Dolphins by a combined score of 137-16
18. Sorry Ravens Flock. But I feel like it will be that 8-8 point in the season for Mike Tomlin and he will sell his soul to the devil for another non-losing season.

Final Record: 11-6, 7-2 at home, 4-4 on the road

Postseason: After a predicted record of 11-6, the Ravens would earn a wildcard spot in the playoffs. I predict them to finish second in the AFC North behind the Bengals. As for the playoffs, I think that if the Ravens are still healthy enough by the end of 18 weeks,  the Super Bowl is not at all out of the question. Realistically, though, I foresee this team losing in either the wildcard or divisional round. But Baltimore is certainly a contender in every game they will play this year, and they have the roster to go all the way."

Erik Burkhardt shares some incredible revelations of former Browns QB Johnny Manziel in The Untold Story of Johnny Football. Here are a few that pertained to the NFL.,nfl,"Just watched the new special, there is a lot revealed about Johnny's college days but a surprising amount about his brief time in the NFL.

First is that Manziel was being drug tested by Burkhardt every week leading up to the NFL Combine. The night before the Combine, Manziel went to a party in the hills. **His Dad faked a heart attack so he could leave the Combine early**.

Second, the Houston Texans were going to take Manziel over Clowney, but video surfaced of him partying not long after his private workout with the team and they took him off their draft board.

Third, Manziel had dinner with the Browns and then partied at a hotel room with his receivers who were going to catch for him the night before a private workout and the receivers were so hungover a hungover himself Manziel **threw to his agent and his lawyer**. He told a reporter who covered the Aggies that he ""fucking killed it"" in the workout. Really.

Finally the second most amazing thing to me behind the fact that **Johnny's family wasn't actually loaded** (I know, right?!?!), Manziel's agent Burkhardt basically begged Jimmy Haslam to **come back in to the first and take Johnny**. Burhardt said his career was on the line. My immediate thoughts on this were holy shit it is cray how fluid the draft is, and now Haslam saying a ""homeless"" guy told him to draft Manziel makes *a lot* more sense.

Pretty crazy stuff and I know a lot of people won't watch here because they don't watch college football so thought I'd share.",t5_2qmg3,1504,263,"Erik Burkhardt shares some incredible revelations of former Browns QB Johnny Manziel in The Untold Story of Johnny Football.

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

Do Rookie Contract QBs have more playoff success than Veteran Contract QBs (some data),nfl,"Since rookie contracts changed in 2011, ~39.58% of NFL teams started a QB on a rookie contract for the majority of the season. So if the QB on a rookie contract strategy of playoff success were best, we’d expect to see these teams outperform teams that have quarterbacks on veteran contracts and make up greater than 39.58% of playoff berths, 1 seeds, Super Bowl appearances, and or Super Bowl wins. 

Since 2011, they tend to underperform this marker. QBs on a rookie contract make up…

* 32.14% of playoff appearances
* 29.17% of 1 seeds 
* 33.33% of Super Bowl appearances (8 times (~1-2 fewer than an expected 9-10)and ~30.4% below expected appearances)
* 16.67% of Super Bowl wins (twice: Mahomes and Russell Wilson (see below about tricky Wentz, 25% with Wentz) 2-3 fewer than an expected 4-5 so 50-60% below the expected number of wins)

If we were to throw out the rookie year of all these QBs starting on a rookie contract (assuming that teams are hoping to take most advantage of that contract year 2-5, rebuilding in year 1) the percentage of teams is reduced from 39.58% to 34%. So even if we throw rookie QBs out of the league count but include their playoff appearances, this gives us the 32.17% slightly underperforming. If we threw out rookie playoff appearances since we threw out rookie seasons, it would go to ~27%. And 1 seed, Super Bowl appearances, and Super Bowl wins all remain the same but still underperform, though not significantly, the now 34%.

Some other fun data points after looking at the ranking of playoff teams cap hit on QBs since 2011(1=highest cap hit on QB, etc), 

* ~25% of playoff teams' QB cap hit rank is 1-6(1Q), the middle ~50% is 7-21 (IQR) and the last ~25% is 22-32 (thus a skew toward spending more) 
* The mean cap hit rank of playoff teams was 15.14 (with 12 playoff teams, the highest possible is 6.5 and lowest is 26.5). The median is 14. 
* For 1 seeds, the mean is 12 with a median is 12. 
* For Super Bowl participants, the mean is 15.79 with a median of 13.5. 
* For Super Bowl winners, the mean is 12.9, the median is 14. 
* Highest percentage of the cap taken up by the QB position while winning a Super Bowl is the Rams with 23.6% of the cap. Highest percentage of the cap to a single QB is Mahomes with 17.19%
* This last year we see the best year for rookie contract QBs by far. Much better than any other year, they represent 43.75% of starters yet make up 57.14% of playoff participants. One of only 3 years (out of 12) they’ve outperformed veteran contract QBs.

**My take:** Obviously not paying a lot for an expensive position is a huge advantage if that QB is capable of taking the team to a super bowl given the right pieces. That's just common sense and no data changes that. The last fun fact about this last year being very successful for rookie contract QBs could be a trend into the future that the league has figured out how to take advantage of that window. 

Also Tom Brady took less money. He didn't take rookie QB money and he's only 1 data points of 14 playoff participants each year. Who's to say a rookie contract QB wins the super bowl 4 times if he takes 5-10 mill more each year. Rodgers just took a paycut, mahomes is going to be underpaid, so I don't think he skews the data insanely and invalidates all the data but something to take into account for sure. 

Obviously anomalies in the data mean this isn't straightforward and the data either way isn't that conclusive. I think regardless, the data does tell us that drafting a QB capable of taking a team to the super bowl is rare enough that veteran contract QBs are just as valid of a strategy to winning a super bowl. And the hailing of the rookie contract as the ultimate strategy people have proclaimed it to be is a bit exaggerated. In all categories (playoff appearances, 1 seeds, Super Bowl appearances, Super Bowl wins) that strategy seems to have a lower to significantly lower rate of success compared to QBs on veteran contracts. So while it's a great strategy, show some love for your veteran QB and don't throw him away just yet.

* For 1 seeds, the mean is 12 with a median is 12. 
* For Super Bowl participants, the mean is 15.79 with a median of 13.5. 
* For Super Bowl winners, the mean is 12.9, the median is 14. 
* Highest percentage of the cap taken up by the QB position while winning a Super Bowl is the Rams with 23.6% of the cap. Highest percentage of the cap to a single QB is Mahomes with 17.19%
* This last year we see the best year for rookie contract QBs by far. Much better than any other year, they represent 43.75% of starters yet make up 57.14% of playoff participants. One of only 3 years (out of 12) they’ve outperformed veteran contract QBs.

**My take:** Obviously not paying a lot for an expensive position is a huge advantage if that QB is capable of taking the team to a super bowl given the right pieces. That's just common sense and no data changes that. The last fun fact about this last year being very successful for rookie contract QBs could be a trend into the future that the league has figured out how to take advantage of that window. 

Also Tom Brady took less money. He didn't take rookie QB money and he's only 1 data points of 14 playoff participants each year. Who's to say a rookie contract QB wins the super bowl 4 times if he takes 5-10 mill more each year. Rodgers just took a paycut, mahomes is going to be underpaid, so I don't think he skews the data insanely and invalidates all the data but something to take into account for sure. 

Obviously anomalies in the data mean this isn't straightforward and the data either way isn't that conclusive. I think regardless, the data does tell us that drafting a QB capable of taking a team to the super bowl is rare enough that veteran contract QBs are just as valid of a strategy to winning a super bowl. And the hailing of the rookie contract as the ultimate strategy people have proclaimed it to be is a bit exaggerated. In all categories (playoff appearances, 1 seeds, Super Bowl appearances, Super Bowl wins) that strategy seems to have a lower to significantly lower rate of success compared to QBs on veteran contracts. So while it's a great strategy, show some love for your veteran QB and don't throw him away just yet.

DISCLAIMER: Data was collected by hand but double checked. Of course let me know if there are mistakes or the data doesn't say what I think it says but as I spent time on this, try to be respectful.

NOTE: Because Carson Wentz didn't participate in the playoffs but did play most the season, I counted that year as a rookie contract QB playoff berth and 1 seed but a veteran contract QB with a low cap hit super bowl victory. If you disagree add a SB win to the rookie contract QB column in the spreadsheet."

2023 Off-season Review Series: Dallas Cowboys,nfl,"**[Dallas Cowboys]**








**Division: [NFC East]**





**Coaching Changes:**






Well, no Moore lighting up the scoreboard, I guess. With the departure of Kellen Moore to the Chargers, things have taken a turn in Jerryworld, and it’s up to new offensive coordinator Brian Cornelius Schottenheimer and Mike Mcarthy’s “Texas Coast Offense” as to whether or not thats a good thing. (Writers note: the Texas coast is 418 miles from ATT Stadium.) 





Schottenheimer, most recently an offensive coordinator in Seattle from ‘18-‘20 and the passing game coordinator under Coach Fingerguns in Jacksonville in ‘21,  is a bit of a milquetoast replacement for Moore. For instance, in his first year in Seattle, he ran the ball 64% of the time on first down, 54% of the time on second down, and passed 73% of the time on third down. Ideal for a team who’s running back room has a guy that has never been a 3 down back, a hobbit, and a few other warm bodies. 




If Schottenhiemer’s reputation for going run run pass wasn’t enough to get Cowboys fans excited, we also rehired Mike Solari as our offensive line coach. I say rehired, because Solari has been an offensive line coach for the Cowboys before- when Tom Landry was the head coach. Solari was most recently with Seattle from ‘18-‘21, and of all the offensive line units of all time, those Seattle units during those years were some of them, consistently grading out in the bottom half of the league in both pass blocking and run blocking according to PFF, and flat out failing the eye test. 




Former Birmingham Iron draft pick Scott Tolzien takes over QB coaching duties from Doug Nussmeier, who went to LA with Moore. Tolzien was a coaching assistant for us last year, and is an all around new face to the coaching community, getting his first job in 2019 as the Wisconsin Badgers scouting analyst. Hopefully he can teach Dak to get his footwork right.





**Free Agency**







There is an Ewok shaped hole in the hearts of all Cowboy fans this year, as we had to cut our worst center but 3rd all time rushing leader in franchise history, Ezekiel Elliot. There are 16.7 million reasons why we had to part ways with Zeke this year,  3.8 yards per carry and an ascending Tony Pollard being chief amongst them. 





As of writing, Zach Martin, our all universe guard, is holding out for a raise, which is reasonable as he is arguably the best guard in the NFL right now and a future Hall of Famer, but is the 8th highest paid guard in the NFL. Pay the man, Jerry, he’s earned it, and we already don’t have depth at offensive line after losing Connor Mgovern to the Jets and with Tyron Smith held together by duct tape, Toradol, and hope. 





Former Bill, Patriot, Panther,  and Colt, Stefon Gilmore rounds out an already stacked Cowboys secondary on a 2yr/ $20 million contract, with $14 million guaranteed. We got a 2 time first team All Pro, 5 time Pro Bowler, Former DPOY for a bag of balls, and a 2023 5th to the Colts. The hope here isn’t that the 33 year old CB repeats his 2019 performance as the DPOY for the Patriots, but that he is simply just good. Surrounded by that suffocating defense, including fellow  first team All Pro CB Trevon Diggs, who signed a 5yr/ $97 million extension at the beginning of camp this year, if he stays healthy and just has an average Stephon Gilmore season, our defense has a chance to be terrifying this year.








Former Saint, Patriot, Ram, and Texan, Brandin Cooks provides a much needed vertical threat at WR on a 2yr/ $39,764,000 contract with $36 million guaranteed. For 2 pick swaps with Houston, a 2023 fifth and 2024 sixth, We get his 4.33 speed, and if the former Belitnikoff award winner just runs wind sprints up and down the field on 9 routes to clear out space for CeeDee to do his thing, he will be well worth the money. 







Former Toronto FC, Bethlehem Steel FC, and Birmingham Stallion Brandon Aubrey will compete for the Kicking job against hopefully someone better than him, as we have just cut former 49er, Charger, and Cardinal Tristan Vizcaino, who was not better than him, so unless we figure out how to hire a football player instead of a soccer player to replace Brett Maher, who forgot you’re supposed to put the ball between the uprights, not every other imaginable place, then i guess we got our guy?






**Draft**





**1.26: Mazi Smith (DT)**




With the 26th overall pick, we took Michigan’s Mazi Smith, with the hopes that he can become the 2 gapping monster in the middle that he was in college. Brian Baldinger compared him to Suh, which is just the insane overreaction i’m looking for in a 1st round Dallas Cowboys draft pick. A+ draft grade for that alone. 





**2.58: Luke Schoonmaker (TE)**




Fellow mitten shaped state (university? Not the one that has the word state in it. I don’t want the blue guys telling me they aren’t the green guys) alumni Luke Schoonmaker is by all accounts just a younger, better version of Dalton Schultz, and continues our weird streak of having a white TE that i’m pretty sure we’ve had going since Billy Joe DuPree retired in 1983. This is a solid B draft grade





**3.90: Demarvion Overshown (LB)**





A converted safety turned linebacker, Demarvion Overshown out of Texas is a coverage specialist at LB that is a fantastic depth piece, his profile reads a ton like Jayron Kearse, so having him at backup just gives Dan Quinn another speedy piece to  add to his arsenal. A solid A for draft grade, simply for getting this guy this late 





**4.129: Viliami Fehoko Jr. (DE)**





Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year Viliami Fehoko Jr out of San Jose State is a bit of a project, as we drafted him for the same reason we drafted Mazi Smith in the first round- we need him to be a run stopper in the middle, so there is some beefing up he has to do to not get killed when moved to DT. This is one of my least favorite picks this year, as it’s not really a position of need after picking up Mazi, and we could have picked up depth at offensive line, but all together he is an interesting player that could potentially turn into something special. Solid C draft grade






**5.169: Asim Richards (OT)**




Out of UNC with an 82 inch wingspan, Asim Richards is going to get moved inside to guard, and is going to compete in training camp with Matt Farniok, Josh Ball, and Chuma Edoga for the backup Left Guard spot. we need depth at OL, and he seems ok for his draft position, solid B for a draft grade 





**6.178: Eric Scott Jr. (CB)**




Wtf Jerry we already have 6 of these what are you doing? That being said we traded up for him, so somebody saw something more nuanced than literally just some guy from the internet. What’s the most neutral grade? C+ or B-? Whichever one is more like distilled water, pick that for the draft grade 





**6.212: Deuce Vaughn (RB)**




The video of Cowboys scout Chris Vaughn calling his son, Deuce Vaughn, to draft him in the 6th round is one of the most heartwarming scenes of this years draft. And it’s not all Kumbaya bullshit, Deuce is a fuckin dawg my dude. He had north of 1500 yards on the ground his senior season at Kansas state, and is a quicker than fast back seemingly built to be and understudy to Tony Pollard. The thing about him though, and it is a thing, is that there are NFL players who own cars who’s rims are taller than Deuce. Mr Vaughn is just 6 inches taller than being legally a dwarf, which brings real limits to his roll in an NFL offense. Draft grade: A+ times 10 plus a million. One of the steals of the draft this year 





**7.244: Jalen Brooks (WR)**





Lmao wut?  7th round for a guy that had 58 catches for 785 yards and 2 td’s at South Carolina? Practice team body at best. Draft grade: Jerry’s internet got disconnected and they went on auto draft 







**Other Offseason News that Affected the Team**





**The Texas Coast Offense**





Ok, listen, I understand people doubting that Brian Cornelius Shottenheimer and Michael John McCarthy could possibly come up with an innovative Offense in 2023, but hear me out, it might not actually suck. I know i gave that horrendous run/pass statistic in the coaching changes section about Shottenheimer, but, those were very cherry picked stats. Yes, he did run 64% on 1st, 53% on second, and passed on 73% of third downs in 2018, but in 2019, it was 54% run on 1st, 47% on second down, and passed on 75% of third downs, and by 2020, he was finally starting to get it, never running more than 50% of the time. And Mike McCarthy never went below a 50% pass/run per down  in his last 2 years at Green Bay. What that hopefully means, especially with the lack of depth at running back, is that the “Texas Coast” offense is ridiculously reliant on Dak’s arm and our absolute arsenal of pass catchers. If we have a TE develop into a safety valve across the middle, be it either Jake Ferguson or Luke Schoonmaker, we will dink and dunk our way deep into the playoffs. The hope here is that Tony Pollard becomes an Austin Ekler type of player, more of a pass catcher than a between the tackles bruiser, not that either couldn’t, but, with realistically one running back on the roster and then a bunch of guys trying their hardest, passes where Pollard steps out of bounds being as frequent as Pollard taking a pounding in the fucking B gap isn’t the worst idea. I reserve my right to not hate it until Week 1





**Zach Martin holding out**




A very recent, and a very urgent issue. Without future HoF Martin, our interior protection, the thing that affects pocket passers the most, which i guess Dak is now, really isn’t very good at all. IDGAF if Jerry has to give Martin 10% of the team, just make it happen. We need him and he has earned more than whatever he is asking for




**Projected Starting Lineup**





**QB: Rayne Dakota Prescott**




It’s now or never for Dak, going into year 8, his age 30 season, with weapons like Brandin Cooks, CeeDee Lamb, Tony Pollard, and a top 3 defense, the expectation is a championship run. If he gets his turnover’s under control, this team can be lethal. He had a career high and league “leading” 15 interceptions last year, and we still finished the season with the second highest turnover differential, at +10. If Dak really can limit it to uNdEr 1o interceptions, which may be harder than it should be given McCarthy’s historical over reliance on spot and curl routes, than by virtue of the sheer number of times we will have the ball, he will put up insane numbers. With his declining rushing abilities, it’s imperative he works on his in the pocket footwork, which is somewhat concerning given he has a new QB coach who is basically in his first real year as a coach. That being said, the sky is the limit this year for Dak, but the floor is beneath the basement, because if he can’t take this team past the divisional, than that will be his legacy. 





**RB Tony Pollard**






At 5.1 yards per carry, Tony Pollard was the third most efficient running back in the league last year, and this year we are going to ask even more of him. We need him to be our lead runner,  which is a massive ask for a guy that has never in his life been a 3 down back. Unless we can get an discounted Zeke, Dalvin Cook, or Leonard Fournette, or a rookie steps up, i’m afraid we are going to run a fresh off a broken left leg and a high ankle sprain Tony Pollard until the wheels fall off. 





**TE1: Jake Ferguson**





2nd year Tight End Jake Ferguson is going to start the year as our TE1, but with second round draft pick Luke Schoonmaker in the TE room, he’s going to have to prove himself not only as a safety valve for Dak this year, but also going to have to improve his run blocking if he’d like to keep the starting job. 





**TE2: Luke Schoonmaker**







The expectations around second round draft pick Luke Schoonmaker are sky high, even if he is off to a rough start- “Schoon” comes into camp with a non football injury on his foot, one that had him in a boot during mini camp. Rookie TE seasons are historically pretty rough, so if he heals up and can be a contributor in 12 personnel this season and gives us hope for the future, the buzz around him next year will be ridiculous  





**WR1: Brandin Cooks**




Entering his year 30 season on his 5th team, Brandin Cooks is going to be our true X Wide Reciever, most likely getting most of his action on the outside edge of the numbers. We have needed a replacement for Amari Cooper for a year now, and by the looks of it, we found our guy- his blazing speed is his greatest asset as a Cowboy, and he will, if not blow the top off defenses, at least clear out some deep defenders to let CeeDee do CeeDee things. A massive upgrade at WR and to our passing game






**WR2: Michael Gallup**






Now a full year after his ACL was torn, Micael Gallup is set for a massive comeback year as our Z receiver. The last time he played a full season without getting hurt and was completely healthy all year, he caught 66 balls for 1107 yards and 6 TD’s.






**Slot WR: CeeDee Lamb**






With Michael Gallup healthy and Brandin Cooks signed, CeeDee will be able to do what he does best this year- be a devastating threat out of the slot position. The only negative thing i can think of when it comes to CeeDee is his celebration- sniffing your finger is weird, man, like, you play one of the most violent contact sports on the planet, are you even sure where that finger was before you sniffed it? 








**LT: Tyron Smith**





The corpse of potential hall of famer Tyron Smith continues to hold down our Left Side when he is healthy. The rare moments of being cleared to play are filled with dominant run and pass blocking that can only be learned through years of experience and winning the genetic lottery, but pick a ligament on the human body. Any one will do. Now pick a year between 2011 and now. I promise, at worst, you’ll be a few years off from when he tore that ligament. Poor guy is an absolute soldier for running it back this year, but my god i hope somebody that loves him sits him down soon to tell him it may be time to hang up the cleats. At this point, i just want him to have a long and healthy retirement, and i’m actually concerned he’s risking that. Stay safe Tyron, and Dallas will always love you






**LG: Tyler Smith**





For a guy that got moved out to Left Tackle his rookie season midway through training camp, Tyler Smith “performed above expectations” the same way Jalen Hurts did last year. In his natural Guard position, hopefully he is a dominate as advertised, but who are we kidding here, He’ll be LT again as soon as Tyron Smith gets hurt. And honestly, he’ll probably be our LT moving forward after this season, guy legitimately does not suck






**C: Tyler Biadasz**







Drafting a Center is as complicated as drafting a quarterback, but drafting a center before like round 5 will get GM’s fired, and because Stephen Jones is smart enough to not want his dad to take back over those responsibilities, Mr. Biadasz will return this year as our Center. He tries his best and we appreciate that, but there is a list of like 15 Centers i’d rather have 







**RG: Zach Martin**






Jerry give this man so many dollars please. The eight time all pro is considered one of the best Offensive Lineman of all time, lets not fuck around and find out with this hold out from camp






**RT: Terrence Steele**






Another guy who exceeded expectations last year, Terrence Steele is a budding star at right tackle, exponentially improving each year since he was drafted in 2020. He’s no Lane Johnson, but most people aren’t, and people who watch this sort of thing think big things about Steele. Definitely one of the more interesting Cowboys to watch this year






**DT: Osa Odighizuwa**






Our definitive DT1 until Mazi proves he is who we think he is, 24 year old Odighizuwa  will have to be the veteran leadership for our IDL group. With 4 sacks and consistent talk about how poor we were at stopping the inside run last year, he seems more like a placeholder for Mazi more than anything we hope to see past week 9 outside of packages that need more than 3 Defensive Lineman






**DT2: Mazi Smith**





Rookie Mazi Smith is going to be asked to be a monster 2 gapping run stopper that shores up one of the very few week points our defense had last year- allowing 129.29 yards per game on the ground last year played a massive roll in our post season embarrassment against that team in Santa Clara. Even if his stats aren’t great this year, as long as he eats both blockers and space and allows Micah and D-Law to fly around, he will be well worth the draft capital we spent on him.  





**DE/Edge: Micah Parsons**






A top 3 defensive player, let alone an edge rusher, we have been building this entire defense around this man for at least a year at this point. Finishing this year outside of the top 3 for DPOY would be a massive let down for Micah, and would probably mean he got injured. The best part of that is that he is still learning how to be an edge rusher- he never did this in college and has only been a pro for 2 years, he’s only going to get better.  






**DE: DeMarcus Lawrence**






With all the buzz around Micah and Diggs, it’s easy to forget that D-Law is an elite pass rusher in his own right, and has been since 2014. The 2 fumble recoveries, 6 sacks, 65 combined tackles and 9 TFL’s he had last year was a down year for him. While he may not repeat his stellar 2017 performance, if he can give us an injury free average year, our defense will be suffocating






**Will LB: Leighton Vander Esch**






Is LVE a good linebacker? No really, i’m asking, because he’s not bad, like i can guarantee you that, i mean 90 Combined tackles is well above “this guy stinks” territory by a good measure, but also, it’s definitely not in elite territory. He was the 46th leading tackler amongst linebackers last year, which is definitely a stat that i had to look up. As much as it sounds like i’m lukewarm on him, i’m not, as he is probably our best true linebacker, but unless he takes a massive leap, he’s just not that exciting to talk about.   






**Mike LB: Jabril Cox**





We haven’t seen much from Cox since he tore his ACL in week 8 of his rookie season in 2021. He played 9 games last year, mostly on special teams, but in college, he was a coverage specialist LB, and with Dan Quinn’s propensity of putting safeties in the box and dropping LB’s into coverage, he is a scheme fit, but so is 4th round pick Demarvion Overshown out of Texas, so if his knee can’t hold up, we do have something in place that will probably be a lateral step instead of a step down







**Sam LB: Damone Clark**







Coming off of a Herniated disk in 2022, there is real hype surrounding Clark in this year’s camp, with Leighton Vander Esch going as far to say “i think we are seeing the beginning of an outstanding career.” Trying to cut through all the hype and glowing words in every article i found about him is challenging- everybody connected to the cowboys absolutely loves this guy. An unknown with a huge upside by the looks of it







**CB1: Trevon Diggs**







The 97 million dollar man will be a cornerstone of our defense this year,  and while Trevon developed a bit of a reputation in ‘21 when he got 11 interceptions but gave up a thousand yards in coverage, he has cleaned up some of his more dangerous risk taking tendencies and has become one of the best all around corners in the league. 







**CB2: Stefon Gillmore**





Having a former DPOY play opposite of Trevon Diggs while Micah Parsons pass rushes feels like cheating. It’s not like he’s really even on the decline either- with 66 combined tackles and 2 interception for the Colts last year, he was an absolute weapon in Indianapolis. 






**CB3: DaRon Bland**




With 5 interceptions, DaRon Bland was one of the best rookie corners in the league last year, which is a big statement when you consider last year’s corner class that included guys like Sauce Gardner and Tariq Woolen. The hope for this year is that he primarily plays slot defender in our nickel sets, and continues his quiet ascension into elite territory.  





**SS: Donavan Wilson**






One of the most underrated safeties in the league, Wilson is an old school you-hear-him-when-he-gets-there hit stick type of player. Can occasionally have issues in coverage, but his ability to defend his run fit is beyond top tier, which is just a perfect scheme fit for Quinn, who loves having Safeties in the box. 







**FS: Jayron Kearse**






Kearse has been doing doing a ton of work for us at the hybrid LB/safety position that Dan Quinn loves, and while 4th rounder Overshown is a insurance in case Jabril Cox can’t make it though this season, long term, Overshown is destined to replace Kearse, so my big hope for him is that he is a good mentor to the younger guys. He’s amazing in his own right, but, come next year, he’s probably a cap casualty, which is super unfair to him, given how well he has played for us the past 2 years. But, with Donavan Wilson and Malik Hooker on the team, it’s hard to justify paying him that big money next contract.







**Nickel Safety: Malik Hooker**







The fact that we have 3 great corners and 3 great safeties has me at a bit of a loss of words while writing this. Malik Hooker is legitimately elite, and he doesn’t even start in this iterations of the Dallas Cowboys because we have that much depth at DB on this team. Saying he doesn’t start is of course very much understating his roll on this defense- with 3 picks and 44 tackles last year, he sees action all of the time, but is he the nickel back or is DaRon Bland? Or is deciding to try and pass the ball on this defense just an overall poor choice? Yes. The answer to both questions is yes. 






**1 K: Brandon Aubrey**







Brandon Aubrey is a soccer player cos playing as a football player. He may be great, i don’t know because i have never seen him kick, nor has anyone else. After Maher, you’d think we’d be dropping real coin on a one year from one of those free agent vets like Gould or Crosby, but hey, at least we got a guy with impeccable cardio i guess.







**1 P: Bryan Anger**






St. Anger was Metallica’s worst album, but with an 83 yard boot against the Bears last year, i know i am not the only cowboys fan that gave that album a re listen .  The album still sucks, but Bryan Anger is a weapon and i’m stoked we kept him for this year






**PR/KR: KaVontae Turpin**






USFL MVP Kavontae Turpin will get a return TD this year, you heard it here first. With 303 total punt return yards and a long of 53, and 508 Kick return yards with a long of 63, this man is an explosive play waiting to happen. I know it’s kind of uncouth to talk about “heart” when it comes to professional athletes, but this man seemingly has it beyond reproach. The former Wroclaw Panther and New Jersey General was destined to be in the NFL, and i’m just glad he and his 4.3 40 found a home in Dallas




**Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses**








**QB:** 









Cooper Rush is a serviceable backup, but if Dak stays healthy and cleans up his interceptions, he will be a top 10 QB this year







**Backfield:** 






Tony Pollard has a chance to be truly great this year, but he is coming off an injury and we have absolutely no depth at RB, so this group also has a chance at being disastrous this year. Maybe Deuce Vaughn steps up and is the guy he was at Kansas State, but at 5’5”, there are real limitations for his roll in the pass catching game at the NFL level. 










**OL:** 





The days of us having the best offensive line in the league is over, unfortunately. There is no way the shambling husk of Tyron Smith will make it through 17 games, and while we can slide Tyler Smith out to LT and slot Chuma Edoga in at Left Guard,  we lack real proven depth at OL. Center Tyler Biadasz, arguably the worst starter on the team, plays next to a Zach Martin, inarguably the best starter on this team, who is holding out from camp as of time of writing, and if he does hold out, our OL goes from pretty good to pretty bad in a pretty big damned hurry. On a brighter note, Terrence Steele is a burgeoning star at right tackle, exponentially improving each year since he was drafted in 2020. 







**Pass catchers:** 




Cooks, Lamb, Pollard sounds like a recipe with an ingredient you gotta go to the “ethnic” grocery store to find, but actually, its a recipe for an offense that will most likely average around 30 points a game this year. Not to mention Gallup, and if we have a TE step up this year, this could be a very potent group if we stay healthy. 







**DL:** 



hopefully the addition of first round draft pick Mazi Smith shores up what was really the achilles heel of a very stout Cowboys defense last year. If he can be a big ol beefy run stuffing monster, we knocked the draft out of the park, if he can be a penetrating pass rushing DT, like Quinn wants him to be, we may have an all time defense on our hands here. Demarcus Lawrence and Micah Parsons, if you can even pigeon hole Parsons into being a DL, don’t hurt, either









**LB:** 






The linebacker room could be considered pretty mid, if it wasn’t for the multi talented Edge Micah Parsons. Leighton Vander Esch, Jabril Cox, and Damone Clark are like washing down a 5 star gourmet meal with tap water. It’s certainly not bad, but it stands out how aggressively average it is when surrounded by excellence. The addition of 3rd round draft pick Demarvion Overshown is very interesting in this linebacker room- he’s a coverage specialist linebacker more akin to Strong Safety Jayron Kearse than anybody in the Linebacker group, and with Dan Quinn’s proclivity for bringing safeties down into the box, he may end up being a real weapon on this defense. i’m not sure if i should be talking about him in this group, or in the secondary group, but because our linebackers need help, i’m going to put him in this group until proven otherwise. 









**Secondary:**







 this is the best group on the team, with Stefon Gilmore, and Trevon Diggs  as the headliners, it’s easy to forget that Jayron Kearse and Donavan Wilson are elite in their own right, and that DaRon Bland would be a starter on most teams and is only our slot guy because we are so utterly stacked everywhere else. 
Special Teams: PR/KR KaVontae Turpin and Punter Brian Anger are bright spots, but with some dude who has never played this sport in any meaningful way as our kicker, I’m not all together against just going for two every time. We need to do some work in free agency and get some ancient, but dependable, kicker like Robbie Gould or Mason Crosby. 






**Schedule Predictions**







**Week 1: DAL @ NYG**






Hopefully we break in Mazi here. Saquon is a problem unless Mazi makes it not a problem. I predict we will either cover the spread, or we will realize real quick that a first round draft pick was a mistake. Dallas -2.5







**Week 2: NYJ @ DAL**







We will lose this one, simply on account of that Aaron Rogers hates the Dallas Cowboys more than Lizzo likes making sure her background dancers have potassium in their diets. I predicted we get dunked on by a weak Green Bay team last year for the same reason, and i was right. If my app has anything less than DAL +6.5 I am hammering the Jets







**Week 3: DAL @ ARZ**







Late September in the desert will either be hot as fuck or simply hot as hell. Which will suck. I hope this is the week we debut Deuce Vaughn, simply as a Kyler Murray is short joke. Cowboys -13.5







**Week 4: NE @ DAL**






Nobody is giving the evil empire credit this year, when their defense is legit terrifying. I think we will win, but, even if nobody is hurt at this point in the year, i am hammering the under on this game. The winner of this game may legitimately not even break 20 points. Cowboys -1.5





**Week 5: DAL @ SF**






It’s a meaningless regular season game, we’ll win, maybe even convincingly, because there is no heartbreak without hope. Cowboys - 3.5 for this meaningless just above exhibition game. +6.5 for the inevitable divisional round playoff game







**Week 6: DAL @ LAC**





Continuing our Californian field trip, we face off against the Chargers in a Kellen Moore revenge game. If this isn’t a prime time game, it’s only because the Chargers Chargered. Flip a coin, if it’s heads, then “i don’t even” and if it’s tails, then it’s “fucking know man.” This by all accounts should be a regular season classic. Dallas +0.5 









**Week 7: BYE**



Honestly we lose this week, having a bye this early is terrible








**Week 8: LAR @ DAL**





Trevon Diggs v. Cooper Kupp. Micah Parsons against Matt Stafford. A bunch of other people that will have their jersey’s framed behind them in their office at the car dealership next year Versus A star studded Dallas team. Just like the Vikings last year, this may be my favorite game of the regular season , because we might win by 30 









**Week 9: DAL @ PHI**






We are for sure going to win one of these this season. Probably not the one where we are gonna get pelted by batteries and clever insults bordering on but not quite encroaching on racial slurs. Going into Philly is going to be tough for anyone this year. I hate you fuckers, but I deeply respect y’all. Dallas +2.5






**Week 10: NYG @ DAL**







The New York Giants had no business going 9-7-1 last year, and over achieved in almost every facet you could have imagined. That being said, Eli signed our stadium when ya’ll beat us when we opened the stadium in 2015, so we’ll cover the spread and this will be the game where every Giants fan understands why the front office didn’t sign Saquon to a long term deal like we did with Zeke, and will be a turning point with Mazi- either he will be the reason Saquon sucks this game, or it will be when we realize that the post season will be awfully familiar this year 









**Week 11: DAL @ CAR**






With all due respect, i don’t know how to say this, unless C.J. Stroud has a rookie RG3 year, i  don’t know how to not be a bit disrespectful here. Carolina has all the potential in the world going into the future, but i would not be shocked of they ended up with a top 5 pick this next draft. That being said we absolutely lose this game for no reason at all other than fuck you, Dallas fan, signed and sincerely, god himself. My estimated spread doesn’t matter when the football gods want to play fuck fuck games. 








**Week 12: WFT @ DAL**











Everybody’s newest not least favorite team, the Washington {redacted} football team commanders are going all in on Sam Howell, and my prediction is that if Howell is still the QB at this point, they steamroll us on the way to an NFC East championship. Definitely going to be a fantastic under bet regardless, but i see Dallas at +2.5 this week






**Week 13: SEA @ DAL**








We got their former OC and OL coach, and a Geno Vr. Dak duel just feels right in general. If Geno can continue his accession, this will be must see TV, if Geno is what we all thought he was before last year, this will be a bad week for anybody that was 12 in 2012. Dallas- 4.5









**Week 14 : PHI @ DAL**






After a dog fight in week 9, both teams will be eager for a rematch with each other in week 14 , in a game that I imagine will have massively important playoff implications. Mazi’s ability to make the 92% conversion rate of Philly’s 3rd and 4th and less than 2 is going to be put in the spotlight more so than he has ever experienced before.   Dallas - 2.5, if and only if we have that dog at DT





**Week 15: DAL @ BUF**






If movies have Oscar bait, than this game is prime time bait if there ever was prime time bait. If things are going the way they should go, than this is not an unreasonable candidate for a super bowl preview. Because it’s the Bills, we will lose the regular season game because we will always handle them in the post season, just like we will win against the 49ers in the regular season but will most assuredly lose if we meet in the post season. Bills win by virtue of a Wide Left by whoever is our kicker, Cowboys +1.5







**Week 16: DAL @ MIA**





Tua has the same odds as making it to this game as Tyron Smith does. Mike White drops 300 a d 4 td’s on us, Cowboys win 34- 28,







**Week 17: DET @ DAL**








This is the game where Detroit locks in 2nd place in the NFC North, Cowboys -3.5 in a game that is going to a brutal back and forth







**Week 18: DAL @ WFT**





This game will not matter, as both tams, for better or for worse, will have locked up their post season standings. We are talking about some real degenerate Jacoby Brisset vr. Cooper Rush shit. Cowboys -.5







Pulled out my ass prediction for the season is 12-5 and a wildcard spot in the post season, inevitably losing to the gold diggers in the NFC Championship game, probably on an embarrassing last play










TL:DR this is our year baybeeeee,we are going to the Supah Bowl",t5_2qmg3,33288,5935,"2023 Off-season Review Series: Dallas Cowboys**[Dallas Cowboys]**








**Division: [NFC East]**





**Coaching Changes:**






Well, no Moore lighting up the scoreboard, I guess. With the departure of Kellen Moore to the Chargers, things have taken a turn in Jerryworld, and it’s up to new offensive coordinator Brian Cornelius Schottenheimer and Mike Mcarthy’s “Texas Coast Offense” as to whether or not thats a good thing. (Writers note: the Texas coast is 418 miles from ATT Stadium.) 





Schottenheimer, most recently an offensive coordinator in Seattle from ‘18-‘20 and the passing game coordinator under Coach Fingerguns in Jacksonville in ‘21,  is a bit of a milquetoast replacement for Moore. For instance, in his first year in Seattle, he ran the ball 64% of the time on first down, 54% of the time on second down, and passed 73% of the time on third down. Ideal for a team who’s running back room has a guy that has never been a 3 down back, a hobbit, and a few other warm bodies. 




If Schottenhiemer’s reputation for going run run pass wasn’t enough to get Cowboys fans excited, we also rehired Mike Solari as our offensive line coach. I say rehired, because Solari has been an offensive line coach for the Cowboys before- when Tom Landry was the head coach. Solari was most recently with Seattle from ‘18-‘21, and of all the offensive line units of all time, those Seattle units during those years were some of them, consistently grading out in the bottom half of the league in both pass blocking and run blocking according to PFF, and flat out failing the eye test. 




Former Birmingham Iron draft pick Scott Tolzien takes over QB coaching duties from Doug Nussmeier, who went to LA with Moore. Tolzien was a coaching assistant for us last year, and is an all around new face to the coaching community, getting his first job in 2019 as the Wisconsin Badgers scouting analyst. Hopefully he can teach Dak to get his footwork right.





**Free Agency**







There is an Ewok shaped hole in the hearts of all Cowboy fans this year, as we had to cut our worst center but 3rd all time rushing leader in franchise history, Ezekiel Elliot. There are 16.7 million reasons why we had to part ways with Zeke this year,  3.8 yards per carry and an ascending Tony Pollard being chief amongst them. 





As of writing, Zach Martin, our all universe guard, is holding out for a raise, which is reasonable as he is arguably the best guard in the NFL right now and a future Hall of Famer, but is the 8th highest paid guard in the NFL. Pay the man, Jerry, he’s earned it, and we already don’t have depth at offensive line after losing Connor Mgovern to the Jets and with Tyron Smith held together by duct tape, Toradol, and hope. 





Former Bill, Patriot, Panther,  and Colt, Stefon Gilmore rounds out an already stacked Cowboys secondary on a 2yr/ $20 million contract, with $14 million guaranteed. We got a 2 time first team All Pro, 5 time Pro Bowler, Former DPOY for a bag of balls, and a 2023 5th to the Colts. The hope here isn’t that the 33 year old CB repeats his 2019 performance as the DPOY for the Patriots, but that he is simply just good. Surrounded by that suffocating defense, including fellow  first team All Pro CB Trevon Diggs, who signed a 5yr/ $97 million extension at the beginning of camp this year, if he stays healthy and just has an average Stephon Gilmore season, our defense has a chance to be terrifying this year.








Former Saint, Patriot, Ram, and Texan, Brandin Cooks provides a much needed vertical threat at WR on a 2yr/ $39,764,000 contract with $36 million guaranteed. For 2 pick swaps with Houston, a 2023 fifth and 2024 sixth, We get his 4.33 speed, and if the former Belitnikoff award winner just runs wind sprints up and down the field on 9 routes to clear out space for CeeDee to do his thing, he will be well worth the money. 







Former Toronto FC, Bethlehem Steel FC, and Birmingham Stallion Brandon Aubrey will compete for the Kicking job against hopefully someone better than him, as we have just cut former 49er, Charger, and Cardinal Tristan Vizcaino, who was not better than him, so unless we figure out how to hire a football player instead of a soccer player to replace Brett Maher, who forgot you’re supposed to put the ball between the uprights, not every other imaginable place, then i guess we got our guy?






**Draft**





**1.26: Mazi Smith (DT)**




With the 26th overall pick, we took Michigan’s Mazi Smith, with the hopes that he can become the 2 gapping monster in the middle that he was in college. Brian Baldinger compared him to Suh, which is just the insane overreaction i’m looking for in a 1st round Dallas Cowboys draft pick. A+ draft grade for that alone. 





**2.58: Luke Schoonmaker (TE)**




Fellow mitten shaped state (university? Not the one that has the word state in it. I don’t want the blue guys telling me they aren’t the green guys) alumni Luke Schoonmaker is by all accounts just a younger, better version of Dalton Schultz, and continues our weird streak of having a white TE that i’m pretty sure we’ve had going since Billy Joe DuPree retired in 1983. This is a solid B draft grade





**3.90: Demarvion Overshown (LB)**





A converted safety turned linebacker, Demarvion Overshown out of Texas is a coverage specialist at LB that is a fantastic depth piece, his profile reads a ton like Jayron Kearse, so having him at backup just gives Dan Quinn another speedy piece to  add to his arsenal. A solid A for draft grade, simply for getting this guy this late 





**4.129: Viliami Fehoko Jr. (DE)**





Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year Viliami Fehoko Jr out of San Jose State is a bit of a project, as we drafted him for the same reason we drafted Mazi Smith in the first round- we need him to be a run stopper in the middle, so there is some beefing up he has to do to not get killed when moved to DT. This is one of my least favorite picks this year, as it’s not really a position of need after picking up Mazi, and we could have picked up depth at offensive line, but all together he is an interesting player that could potentially turn into something special. Solid C draft grade






**5.169: Asim Richards (OT)**




Out of UNC with an 82 inch wingspan, Asim Richards is going to get moved inside to guard, and is going to compete in training camp with Matt Farniok, Josh Ball, and Chuma Edoga for the backup Left Guard spot. we need depth at OL, and he seems ok for his draft position, solid B for a draft grade 





**6.178: Eric Scott Jr. (CB)**




Wtf Jerry we already have 6 of these what are you doing? That being said we traded up for him, so somebody saw something more nuanced than literally just some guy from the internet. What’s the most neutral grade? C+ or B-? Whichever one is more like distilled water, pick that for the draft grade 





**6.212: Deuce Vaughn (RB)**




The video of Cowboys scout Chris Vaughn calling his son, Deuce Vaughn, to draft him in the 6th round is one of the most heartwarming scenes of this years draft. And it’s not all Kumbaya bullshit, Deuce is a fuckin dawg my dude. He had north of 1500 yards on the ground his senior season at Kansas state, and is a quicker than fast back seemingly built to be and understudy to Tony Pollard. The thing about him though, and it is a thing, is that there are NFL players who own cars who’s rims are taller than Deuce. Mr Vaughn is just 6 inches taller than being legally a dwarf, which brings real limits to his roll in an NFL offense. Draft grade: A+ times 10 plus a million. One of the steals of the draft this year 





**7.244: Jalen Brooks (WR)**





Lmao wut?  7th round for a guy that had 58 catches for 785 yards and 2 td’s at South Carolina? Practice team body at best. Draft grade: Jerry’s internet got disconnected and they went on auto draft 







**Other Offseason News that Affected the Team**





**The Texas Coast Offense**





Ok, listen, I understand people doubting that Brian Cornelius Shottenheimer and Michael John McCarthy could possibly come up with an innovative Offense in 2023, but hear me out, it might not actually suck. I know i gave that horrendous run/pass statistic in the coaching changes section about Shottenheimer, but, those were very cherry picked stats. Yes, he did run 64% on 1st, 53% on second, and passed on 73% of third downs in 2018, but in 2019, it was 54% run on 1st, 47% on second down, and passed on 75% of third downs, and by 2020, he was finally starting to get it, never running more than 50% of the time. And Mike McCarthy never went below a 50% pass/run per down  in his last 2 years at Green Bay. What that hopefully means, especially with the lack of depth at running back, is that the “Texas Coast” offense is ridiculously reliant on Dak’s arm and our absolute arsenal of pass catchers. If we have a TE develop into a safety valve across the middle, be it either Jake Ferguson or Luke Schoonmaker, we will dink and dunk our way deep into the playoffs. The hope here is that Tony Pollard becomes an Austin Ekler type of player, more of a pass catcher than a between the tackles bruiser, not that either couldn’t, but, with realistically one running back on the roster and then a bunch of guys trying their hardest, passes where Pollard steps out of bounds being as frequent as Pollard taking a pounding in the fucking B gap isn’t the worst idea. I reserve my right to not hate it until Week 1





**Zach Martin holding out**




A very recent, and a very urgent issue. Without future HoF Martin, our interior protection, the thing that affects pocket passers the most, which i guess Dak is now, really isn’t very good at all. IDGAF if Jerry has to give Martin 10% of the team, just make it happen. We need him and he has earned more than whatever he is asking for




**Projected Starting Lineup**





**QB: Rayne Dakota Prescott**




It’s now or never for Dak, going into year 8, his age 30 season, with weapons like Brandin Cooks, CeeDee Lamb, Tony Pollard, and a top 3 defense, the expectation is a championship run. If he gets his turnover’s under control, this team can be lethal. He had a career high and league “leading” 15 interceptions last year, and we still finished the season with the second highest turnover differential, at +10. If Dak really can limit it to uNdEr 1o interceptions, which may be harder than it should be given McCarthy’s historical over reliance on spot and curl routes, than by virtue of the sheer number of times we will have the ball, he will put up insane numbers. With his declining rushing abilities, it’s imperative he works on his in the pocket footwork, which is somewhat concerning given he has a new QB coach who is basically in his first real year as a coach. That being said, the sky is the limit this year for Dak, but the floor is beneath the basement, because if he can’t take this team past the divisional, than that will be his legacy. 





**RB Tony Pollard**






At 5.1 yards per carry, Tony Pollard was the third most efficient running back in the league last year, and this year we are going to ask even more of him. We need him to be our lead runner,  which is a massive ask for a guy that has never in his life been a 3 down back. Unless we can get an discounted Zeke, Dalvin Cook, or Leonard Fournette, or a rookie steps up, i’m afraid we are going to run a fresh off a broken left leg and a high ankle sprain Tony Pollard until the wheels fall off. 





**TE1: Jake Ferguson**





2nd year Tight End Jake Ferguson is going to start the year as our TE1, but with second round draft pick Luke Schoonmaker in the TE room, he’s going to have to prove himself not only as a safety valve for Dak this year, but also going to have to improve his run blocking if he’d like to keep the starting job. 





**TE2: Luke Schoonmaker**







The expectations around second round draft pick Luke Schoonmaker are sky high, even if he is off to a rough start- “Schoon” comes into camp with a non football injury on his foot, one that had him in a boot during mini camp. Rookie TE seasons are historically pretty rough, so if he heals up and can be a contributor in 12 personnel this season and gives us hope for the future, the buzz around him next year will be ridiculous  





**WR1: Brandin Cooks**




Entering his year 30 season on his 5th team, Brandin Cooks is going to be our true X Wide Reciever, most likely getting most of his action on the outside edge of the numbers. We have needed a replacement for Amari Cooper for a year now, and by the looks of it, we found our guy- his blazing speed is his greatest asset as a Cowboy, and he will, if not blow the top off defenses, at least clear out some deep defenders to let CeeDee do CeeDee things. A massive upgrade at WR and to our passing game






**WR2: Michael Gallup**






Now a full year after his ACL was torn, Micael Gallup is set for a massive comeback year as our Z receiver. The last time he played a full season without getting hurt and was completely healthy all year, he caught 66 balls for 1107 yards and 6 TD’s.






**Slot WR: CeeDee Lamb**






With Michael Gallup healthy and Brandin Cooks signed, CeeDee will be able to do what he does best this year- be a devastating threat out of the slot position. The only negative thing i can think of when it comes to CeeDee is his celebration- sniffing your finger is weird, man, like, you play one of the most violent contact sports on the planet, are you even sure where that finger was before you sniffed it? 








**LT: Tyron Smith**





The corpse of potential hall of famer Tyron Smith continues to hold down our Left Side when he is healthy. The rare moments of being cleared to play are filled with dominant run and pass blocking that can only be learned through years of experience and winning the genetic lottery, but pick a ligament on the human body. Any one will do. Now pick a year between 2011 and now. I promise, at worst, you’ll be a few years off from when he tore that ligament. Poor guy is an absolute soldier for running it back this year, but my god i hope somebody that loves him sits him down soon to tell him it may be time to hang up the cleats. At this point, i just want him to have a long and healthy retirement, and i’m actually concerned he’s risking that. Stay safe Tyron, and Dallas will always love you






**LG: Tyler Smith**





For a guy that got moved out to Left Tackle his rookie season midway through training camp, Tyler Smith “performed above expectations” the same way Jalen Hurts did last year. In his natural Guard position, hopefully he is a dominate as advertised, but who are we kidding here, He’ll be LT again as soon as Tyron Smith gets hurt. And honestly, he’ll probably be our LT moving forward after this season, guy legitimately does not suck






**C: Tyler Biadasz**







Drafting a Center is as complicated as drafting a quarterback, but drafting a center before like round 5 will get GM’s fired, and because Stephen Jones is smart enough to not want his dad to take back over those responsibilities, Mr. Biadasz will return this year as our Center. He tries his best and we appreciate that, but there is a list of like 15 Centers i’d rather have 







**RG: Zach Martin**






Jerry give this man so many dollars please. The eight time all pro is considered one of the best Offensive Lineman of all time, lets not fuck around and find out with this hold out from camp






**RT: Terrence Steele**






Another guy who exceeded expectations last year, Terrence Steele is a budding star at right tackle, exponentially improving each year since he was drafted in 2020. He’s no Lane Johnson, but most people aren’t, and people who watch this sort of thing think big things about Steele. Definitely one of the more interesting Cowboys to watch this year






**DT: Osa Odighizuwa**






Our definitive DT1 until Mazi proves he is who we think he is, 24 year old Odighizuwa  will have to be the veteran leadership for our IDL group. With 4 sacks and consistent talk about how poor we were at stopping the inside run last year, he seems more like a placeholder for Mazi more than anything we hope to see past week 9 outside of packages that need more than 3 Defensive Lineman






**DT2: Mazi Smith**





Rookie Mazi Smith is going to be asked to be a monster 2 gapping run stopper that shores up one of the very few week points our defense had last year- allowing 129.29 yards per game on the ground last year played a massive roll in our post season embarrassment against that team in Santa Clara. Even if his stats aren’t great this year, as long as he eats both blockers and space and allows Micah and D-Law to fly around, he will be well worth the draft capital we spent on him.  





**DE/Edge: Micah Parsons**






A top 3 defensive player, let alone an edge rusher, we have been building this entire defense around this man for at least a year at this point. Finishing this year outside of the top 3 for DPOY would be a massive let down for Micah, and would probably mean he got injured. The best part of that is that he is still learning how to be an edge rusher- he never did this in college and has only been a pro for 2 years, he’s only going to get better.  






**DE: DeMarcus Lawrence**






With all the buzz around Micah and Diggs, it’s easy to forget that D-Law is an elite pass rusher in his own right, and has been since 2014. The 2 fumble recoveries, 6 sacks, 65 combined tackles and 9 TFL’s he had last year was a down year for him. While he may not repeat his stellar 2017 performance, if he can give us an injury free average year, our defense will be suffocating






**Will LB: Leighton Vander Esch**






Is LVE a good linebacker? No really, i’m asking, because he’s not bad, like i can guarantee you that, i mean 90 Combined tackles is well above “this guy stinks” territory by a good measure, but also, it’s definitely not in elite territory. He was the 46th leading tackler amongst linebackers last year, which is definitely a stat that i had to look up. As much as it sounds like i’m lukewarm on him, i’m not, as he is probably our best true linebacker, but unless he takes a massive leap, he’s just not that exciting to talk about.   






**Mike LB: Jabril Cox**





We haven’t seen much from Cox since he tore his ACL in week 8 of his rookie season in 2021. He played 9 games last year, mostly on special teams, but in college, he was a coverage specialist LB, and with Dan Quinn’s propensity of putting safeties in the box and dropping LB’s into coverage, he is a scheme fit, but so is 4th round pick Demarvion Overshown out of Texas, so if his knee can’t hold up, we do have something in place that will probably be a lateral step instead of a step down







**Sam LB: Damone Clark**







Coming off of a Herniated disk in 2022, there is real hype surrounding Clark in this year’s camp, with Leighton Vander Esch going as far to say “i think we are seeing the beginning of an outstanding career.” Trying to cut through all the hype and glowing words in every article i found about him is challenging- everybody connected to the cowboys absolutely loves this guy. An unknown with a huge upside by the looks of it







**CB1: Trevon Diggs**







The 97 million dollar man will be a cornerstone of our defense this year,  and while Trevon developed a bit of a reputation in ‘21 when he got 11 interceptions but gave up a thousand yards in coverage, he has cleaned up some of his more dangerous risk taking tendencies and has become one of the best all around corners in the league. 







**CB2: Stefon Gillmore**





Having a former DPOY play opposite of Trevon Diggs while Micah Parsons pass rushes feels like cheating. It’s not like he’s really even on the decline either- with 66 combined tackles and 2 interception for the Colts last year, he was an absolute weapon in Indianapolis. 






**CB3: DaRon Bland**




With 5 interceptions, DaRon Bland was one of the best rookie corners in the league last year, which is a big statement when you consider last year’s corner class that included guys like Sauce Gardner and Tariq Woolen. The hope for this year is that he primarily plays slot defender in our nickel sets, and continues his quiet ascension into elite territory.  





**SS: Donavan Wilson**






One of the most underrated safeties in the league, Wilson is an old school you-hear-him-when-he-gets-there hit stick type of player. Can occasionally have issues in coverage, but his ability to defend his run fit is beyond top tier, which is just a perfect scheme fit for Quinn, who loves having Safeties in the box. 







**FS: Jayron Kearse**






Kearse has been doing doing a ton of work for us at the hybrid LB/safety position that Dan Quinn loves, and while 4th rounder Overshown is a insurance in case Jabril Cox can’t make it though this season, long term, Overshown is destined to replace Kearse, so my big hope for him is that he is a good mentor to the younger guys. He’s amazing in his own right, but, come next year, he’s probably a cap casualty, which is super unfair to him, given how well he has played for us the past 2 years. But, with Donavan Wilson and Malik Hooker on the team, it’s hard to justify paying him that big money next contract.







**Nickel Safety: Malik Hooker**







The fact that we have 3 great corners and 3 great safeties has me at a bit of a loss of words while writing this. Malik Hooker is legitimately elite, and he doesn’t even start in this iterations of the Dallas Cowboys because we have that much depth at DB on this team. Saying he doesn’t start is of course very much understating his roll on this defense- with 3 picks and 44 tackles last year, he sees action all of the time, but is he the nickel back or is DaRon Bland? Or is deciding to try and pass the ball on this defense just an overall poor choice? Yes. The answer to both questions is yes. 






**1 K: Brandon Aubrey**







Brandon Aubrey is a soccer player cos playing as a football player. He may be great, i don’t know because i have never seen him kick, nor has anyone else. After Maher, you’d think we’d be dropping real coin on a one year from one of those free agent vets like Gould or Crosby, but hey, at least we got a guy with impeccable cardio i guess.







**1 P: Bryan Anger**






St. Anger was Metallica’s worst album, but with an 83 yard boot against the Bears last year, i know i am not the only cowboys fan that gave that album a re listen .  The album still sucks, but Bryan Anger is a weapon and i’m stoked we kept him for this year






**PR/KR: KaVontae Turpin**






USFL MVP Kavontae Turpin will get a return TD this year, you heard it here first. With 303 total punt return yards and a long of 53, and 508 Kick return yards with a long of 63, this man is an explosive play waiting to happen. I know it’s kind of uncouth to talk about “heart” when it comes to professional athletes, but this man seemingly has it beyond reproach. The former Wroclaw Panther and New Jersey General was destined to be in the NFL, and i’m just glad he and his 4.3 40 found a home in Dallas




**Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses**








**QB:** 









Cooper Rush is a serviceable backup, but if Dak stays healthy and cleans up his interceptions, he will be a top 10 QB this year







**Backfield:** 






Tony Pollard has a chance to be truly great this year, but he is coming off an injury and we have absolutely no depth at RB, so this group also has a chance at being disastrous this year. Maybe Deuce Vaughn steps up and is the guy he was at Kansas State, but at 5’5”, there are real limitations for his roll in the pass catching game at the NFL level. 










**OL:** 





The days of us having the best offensive line in the league is over, unfortunately. There is no way the shambling husk of Tyron Smith will make it through 17 games, and while we can slide Tyler Smith out to LT and slot Chuma Edoga in at Left Guard,  we lack real proven depth at OL. Center Tyler Biadasz, arguably the worst starter on the team, plays next to a Zach Martin, inarguably the best starter on this team, who is holding out from camp as of time of writing, and if he does hold out, our OL goes from pretty good to pretty bad in a pretty big damned hurry. On a brighter note, Terrence Steele is a burgeoning star at right tackle, exponentially improving each year since he was drafted in 2020. 







**Pass catchers:** 




Cooks, Lamb, Pollard sounds like a recipe with an ingredient you gotta go to the “ethnic” grocery store to find, but actually, its a recipe for an offense that will most likely average around 30 points a game this year. Not to mention Gallup, and if we have a TE step up this year, this could be a very potent group if we stay healthy. 







**DL:** 



hopefully the addition of first round draft pick Mazi Smith shores up what was really the achilles heel of a very stout Cowboys defense last year. If he can be a big ol beefy run stuffing monster, we knocked the draft out of the park, if he can be a penetrating pass rushing DT, like Quinn wants him to be, we may have an all time defense on our hands here. Demarcus Lawrence and Micah Parsons, if you can even pigeon hole Parsons into being a DL, don’t hurt, either









**LB:** 






The linebacker room could be considered pretty mid, if it wasn’t for the multi talented Edge Micah Parsons. Leighton Vander Esch, Jabril Cox, and Damone Clark are like washing down a 5 star gourmet meal with tap water. It’s certainly not bad, but it stands out how aggressively average it is when surrounded by excellence. The addition of 3rd round draft pick Demarvion Overshown is very interesting in this linebacker room- he’s a coverage specialist linebacker more akin to Strong Safety Jayron Kearse than anybody in the Linebacker group, and with Dan Quinn’s proclivity for bringing safeties down into the box, he may end up being a real weapon on this defense. i’m not sure if i should be talking about him in this group, or in the secondary group, but because our linebackers need help, i’m going to put him in this group until proven otherwise. 









**Secondary:**







 this is the best group on the team, with Stefon Gilmore, and Trevon Diggs  as the headliners, it’s easy to forget that Jayron Kearse and Donavan Wilson are elite in their own right, and that DaRon Bland would be a starter on most teams and is only our slot guy because we are so utterly stacked everywhere else. 
Special Teams: PR/KR KaVontae Turpin and Punter Brian Anger are bright spots, but with some dude who has never played this sport in any meaningful way as our kicker, I’m not all together against just going for two every time. We need to do some work in free agency and get some ancient, but dependable, kicker like Robbie Gould or Mason Crosby. 






**Schedule Predictions**







**Week 1: DAL @ NYG**






Hopefully we break in Mazi here. Saquon is a problem unless Mazi makes it not a problem. I predict we will either cover the spread, or we will realize real quick that a first round draft pick was a mistake. Dallas -2.5







**Week 2: NYJ @ DAL**







We will lose this one, simply on account of that Aaron Rogers hates the Dallas Cowboys more than Lizzo likes making sure her background dancers have potassium in their diets. I predicted we get dunked on by a weak Green Bay team last year for the same reason, and i was right. If my app has anything less than DAL +6.5 I am hammering the Jets







**Week 3: DAL @ ARZ**







Late September in the desert will either be hot as fuck or simply hot as hell. Which will suck. I hope this is the week we debut Deuce Vaughn, simply as a Kyler Murray is short joke. Cowboys -13.5







**Week 4: NE @ DAL**






Nobody is giving the evil empire credit this year, when their defense is legit terrifying. I think we will win, but, even if nobody is hurt at this point in the year, i am hammering the under on this game. The winner of this game may legitimately not even break 20 points. Cowboys -1.5





**Week 5: DAL @ SF**






It’s a meaningless regular season game, we’ll win, maybe even convincingly, because there is no heartbreak without hope. Cowboys - 3.5 for this meaningless just above exhibition game. +6.5 for the inevitable divisional round playoff game







**Week 6: DAL @ LAC**





Continuing our Californian field trip, we face off against the Chargers in a Kellen Moore revenge game. If this isn’t a prime time game, it’s only because the Chargers Chargered. Flip a coin, if it’s heads, then “i don’t even” and if it’s tails, then it’s “fucking know man.” This by all accounts should be a regular season classic. Dallas +0.5 









**Week 7: BYE**



Honestly we lose this week, having a bye this early is terrible








**Week 8: LAR @ DAL**





Trevon Diggs v. Cooper Kupp. Micah Parsons against Matt Stafford. A bunch of other people that will have their jersey’s framed behind them in their office at the car dealership next year Versus A star studded Dallas team. Just like the Vikings last year, this may be my favorite game of the regular season , because we might win by 30 









**Week 9: DAL @ PHI**






We are for sure going to win one of these this season. Probably not the one where we are gonna get pelted by batteries and clever insults bordering on but not quite encroaching on racial slurs. Going into Philly is going to be tough for anyone this year. I hate you fuckers, but I deeply respect y’all. Dallas +2.5






**Week 10: NYG @ DAL**







The New York Giants had no business going 9-7-1 last year, and over achieved in almost every facet you could have imagined. That being said, Eli signed our stadium when ya’ll beat us when we opened the stadium in 2015, so we’ll cover the spread and this will be the game where every Giants fan understands why the front office didn’t sign Saquon to a long term deal like we did with Zeke, and will be a turning point with Mazi- either he will be the reason Saquon sucks this game, or it will be when we realize that the post season will be awfully familiar this year 









**Week 11: DAL @ CAR**






With all due respect, i don’t know how to say this, unless C.J. Stroud has a rookie RG3 year, i  don’t know how to not be a bit disrespectful here. Carolina has all the potential in the world going into the future, but i would not be shocked of they ended up with a top 5 pick this next draft. That being said we absolutely lose this game for no reason at all other than fuck you, Dallas fan, signed and sincerely, god himself. My estimated spread doesn’t matter when the football gods want to play fuck fuck games. 








**Week 12: WFT @ DAL**











Everybody’s newest not least favorite team, the Washington {redacted} football team commanders are going all in on Sam Howell, and my prediction is that if Howell is still the QB at this point, they steamroll us on the way to an NFC East championship. Definitely going to be a fantastic under bet regardless, but i see Dallas at +2.5 this week






**Week 13: SEA @ DAL**








We got their former OC and OL coach, and a Geno Vr. Dak duel just feels right in general. If Geno can continue his accession, this will be must see TV, if Geno is what we all thought he was before last year, this will be a bad week for anybody that was 12 in 2012. Dallas- 4.5









**Week 14 : PHI @ DAL**






After a dog fight in week 9, both teams will be eager for a rematch with each other in week 14 , in a game that I imagine will have massively important playoff implications. Mazi’s ability to make the 92% conversion rate of Philly’s 3rd and 4th and less than 2 is going to be put in the spotlight more so than he has ever experienced before.   Dallas - 2.5, if and only if we have that dog at DT





**Week 15: DAL @ BUF**






If movies have Oscar bait, than this game is prime time bait if there ever was prime time bait. If things are going the way they should go, than this is not an unreasonable candidate for a super bowl preview. Because it’s the Bills, we will lose the regular season game because we will always handle them in the post season, just like we will win against the 49ers in the regular season but will most assuredly lose if we meet in the post season. Bills win by virtue of a Wide Left by whoever is our kicker, Cowboys +1.5







**Week 16: DAL @ MIA**





Tua has the same odds as making it to this game as Tyron Smith does. Mike White drops 300 a d 4 td’s on us, Cowboys win 34- 28,







**Week 17: DET @ DAL**








This is the game where Detroit locks in 2nd place in the NFC North, Cowboys -3.5 in a game that is going to a brutal back and forth







**Week 18: DAL @ WFT**





This game will not matter, as both tams, for better or for worse, will have locked up their post season standings. We are talking about some real degenerate Jacoby Brisset vr. Cooper Rush shit. Cowboys -.5







Pulled out my ass prediction for the season is 12-5 and a wildcard spot in the post season, inevitably losing to the gold diggers in the NFC Championship game, probably on an embarrassing last play










TL:DR this is our year baybeeeee,we are going to the Supah Bowl"

In 2006 Adam Vinatieri had the best postseason performance by kicker.,nfl,"In 2006 Adam Vinatieri had joined the Colts as a free agent after the Colts were fed up with Mike Vanderjagt shanking in the post season. The Colts went 12-4 in the regular season and held the 3rd seed. 

**In that postseason he scored 49 points for the Colts. He is 1 of 2 kickers to break 40 points in the post season with the other being Evan McPherson in 2021 with 48** 

He achieved this by scoring **14** field goals out of **15** attempts  and 7 extra point attempts. 14 field goals made is the most in any post season.

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Indianapolis Colts**

--------------",t5_2qmg3,2521,176,"The 2023 r/NFL Roast of The Carolina Panthers (14/32)###WELCOME TO THE 2023 R/NFL ROAST OF THE CAROLINA PANTHERS 

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Indianapolis Colts**

1st Round rookie pre-season stats all in one place,nfl,"Hey gang, if you're interested in checking out the basic box score stats for 1st-round rookies, I consolidated this for week 1. I don't have listed some top rookie performances that weren't drafted in round one.  If you know of any great performances or stat lines from some rookies drafted outside of round one, please drop them in the comments for others to see (such as Bears rookie, Tyrique Stevenson with 7 tackles and a PD). Any other commentary we can see in the stats would be good as well, for example Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter both got a QB hit in their game.

"Super Bowl QBs Preseason Debut or Forget It Jake, It's Preseason FB",nfl,"I see a lot of post by Armchair QB Coaches about how they can tell that a QB will be a bust by their first preseason start. Let's go ahead and look back on the last 11 Super Bowl Winning QBs and how their first looks. (Would do more, but Payton and Tom were hard enough from the late 90's, Trent Dillfer and Brad Johnson from the early 90's is rough).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;


1. Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs 2022 &amp; 2019

&amp;#x200B;

First Game Aug 12th 2017 SF @ KC, 1st Preseason Game of Rookie Year

&amp;#x200B;

7 of 9 for 49 yards, 13 Plays, 3 Drives, 3 First Downs, a FG, a TD and a Punt. Didn't come in until 2nd half, his first 2 First Downs came from penalties. His first TD Drive started on his opponents 8 after a blocked punt. Only one completed pass over 10 yards, a 16 yarder. Taken out after his 3rd drive.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. Matthew Stafford, Rams 2021

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 15th 2009 ATL @ DET, 1st Preseason Game Rookie Year

&amp;#x200B;

7 of 14 for 114 yards, 5 yards rushing, 21 Plays, 4 Drives, 6 First Downs, 2 Punts, 1 Pick Six, 1 TD. Came in just before the 2-minute warning in the first half. Ran 2 drives that both ended in punts. Threw a pick six his first throw of the second half. The next drive he takes the Lions 80 yards for a TD with 3 20+ yards throws. Longest completed pass, the 25 yard TD. Taken out after his 4th drive.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. Tom Brady, Tampa 2020, Patriots 2018, 2016, 2014, 2004, 2003, 2001

&amp;#x200B;

First Game July 31st 2000 NE vs SF HOF Game, 1st Preseason Game Rookie Year

&amp;#x200B;

3 of 4 for 28 yards, he came in the 4th quarter, it was one drive and 2 First Downs. Honestly can't find out much else. (It's a preseason game)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4. Nick Foles, Eagles 2017

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 10th 2012 PIT @ PHI, 1st Preseason Game

&amp;#x200B;

5 of 9 for 144 yards, 14 Plays, 5 Drives, 1 First Down, 3 Punts, 2 TDs. 3 completions over 10+ yards, including both a 70 yard and 44 yard TD. He came in at the start of the 2nd Half. I maybe biased, since I dated his sister right around this time, but based on this preseason performance he will be the greatest QB ever.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

5. Payton Manning, Broncos 2015, Colts 2006

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 8th 1998 IND @ SEA, 1st Preseason Game

&amp;#x200B;

8 of 15 for 115 yards and at least 1 48 yard TD, he played the whole 1st half. Can't find much more info for the game. Once again, it's only preseason.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

6. Russel Wilson, Seahawks 2013

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 11th 2012 TEN @ SEA, 1st Preseason Game

&amp;#x200B;

9 of 13 for 99 yards, 23 Rushing on 1 attempt, 19 Plays, 3 Drives, 4 First Downs, 1 TD, 2 Punt. He entered at the start of the 2nd half, and left after 3 Drives.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

7. Joe Flacco, Ravens 2012

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 7th 2008 BAL @ NE, 1st Preseason Game

&amp;#x200B;

0 of 3, 2 Sacks, 1 Fumble, -6 Yards Rushing. Sometimes a Super Bowl Winning QB doesn't even complete a pass on their first preseason game.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

8. Eli Manning, Giants 2011 &amp; 2007

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 13th 2004 NYG vs KC, 1st Preseason Game

&amp;#x200B;

7 of 13 for 91 Yards, 2 Sacks, -16 Yards Rushing. Longest Throw 24 Yards. He came in at the start of the second half. Fitting that Eli gets his first taste of Pro Football on Friday the 13th.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

9. Aaron Rodgers, Packers 2010

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 11th 2005 SD @ GB, 1st Preseason Game

&amp;#x200B;

2 of 6 for 7 yards, 2 Sacks, -5 Yards Rushing. Longest Throw 6 Yards. Not much else.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

10. Drew Brees, Saints 2009

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 11th 2001 SD vs SF, 1st Preseason Game

&amp;#x200B;

1 Drive, 1 TD and Sat Backdown. All I can find.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

11. Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers 2008 &amp; 2005

&amp;#x200B;

First Game August 14th 2004 PIT @ DET, 1st Preseason Game

&amp;#x200B;

8 of 13 for 84 yards, 1 TD, 4 Drives, Longest Throw 15 yards. He was in the game during the 2nd Quarter, but did not start.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; A QB's 1st Preseason Game predicts absolutely nothing about how they will perform and develop. If it did, Nick Foles would be the greatest SB QB and Eli Manning, Aaron Rodgers and Joe Flacco would have been run out of the league before the season even began.


EDIT: Also Nick Foles and Drew Brees are both from Austin, Texas and played for Westlake High. If you get a QB who played at Westlake High and they score a TD in their first preseason game, they might win a Superbowl.

Why did the Falcons' Bijan Robinson pick not receive more hate?,nfl,"The narrative in the last 4 years or so has been that you don't take a running back in the first round and some even believe you don't do it in the 2nd. I followed the draft extremely close and for months and months leading up to it, all the usual experts and pundits were saying it was a bad idea. Then the Falcons took a running back in the TOP TEN &amp; most of the analysts began turning around and praising the pick, highlighting why its such a great move. It was like none of the ""running back early bad"" stuff ever happened. Im not here to say whether drafting a RB early is a poor decision or not, but why is the media so inconsistent with their stance. So just wondering how that all works.

Bijan was fantastic in college. He will probably finish top 3 in rushing this year. Im not trying to say it deserved any backlash or not, I was just expecting the media and fans to absolutely shred them for it after years and years of taking that stance.",t5_2qmg3,955,184,"Why did the Falcons' Bijan Robinson pick not receive more hate?The narrative in the last 4 years or so has been that you don't take a running back in the first round and some even believe you don't do it in the 2nd.

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

\*Denotes Hall of Famer

\*\*Mike Mercer was traded from the Raiders to the Chiefs two games into the 1966 season. Since he still would've led the AFL in field goals if you exclude his two games with the Raiders, I have him listed with the Chiefs but also included his full season statistics in parentheses.

Teams without a field goal leader:

* Cincinnati Bengals (est. 1968)
* Seattle Seahawks (est. 1976)
* Jacksonville Jaguars (est. 1995)

Now, I know the question that is on EVERYBODIES mind after reading this.

Yes, Rex Grossman is the grandfather of Sexy Rexy. I honestly have nothing else to add here, this alone makes this more than worth posting.

Also, one quick point of mention, statistics for field goal attempts and extra point attempts are incomplete prior to 1938, so attempts for those seasons will be listed as N/A.

\^Also led the NFL

\*Denotes Hall of Famer

\*\*Mike Mercer was traded from the Raiders to the Chiefs two games into the 1966 season. Since he still would've led the AFL in field goals if you exclude his two games with the Raiders, I have him listed with the Chiefs but also included his full season statistics in parentheses.

Teams without a field goal leader:

* Cincinnati Bengals (est. 1968)
* Seattle Seahawks (est. 1976)
* Jacksonville Jaguars (est. 1995)

Now, I know the question that is on EVERYBODIES mind after reading this.

Yes, Rex Grossman is the grandfather of Sexy Rexy. I honestly have nothing else to add here, this alone makes this more than worth posting.

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

- Fan favourite and one of the players who has been on the team the longest, **DeAndre Houston-Carson**, is a current FA without any indication of being re-signed.

###Other Offseason News that Affected the Team

&amp;nbsp;

* Arlington Heights might be the location for the Bear's new stadium. That said they still seem to be entertaining ideas for other locations.

* To the chagrin of PETA supporters everywhere, Fields is no longer a vegan. He's shed that label to don that of a pescatarian. The world is holding its breath.

&amp;nbsp;

###Position Group Strengths &amp; Weaknesses

&amp;nbsp;

**QB** - Slight Strength - This is the year for Fields to prove to everyone he is mislabeled. His execution/decisiveness needs to improve. P.J. Walker is a solid backup and Nathan Peterman seems to be a good player/coach.

&amp;nbsp;

**RB** - Strength -  The Bears seem to be all in on the new approach to RBs, having a few guys for cheap rather than one three-down back. With several recognizable names in this group, it will likely be an RB by committee approach.

&amp;nbsp;

**WR** - Strength - D.J. Moore is an obvious upgrade. Add in Darnell Mooney and Chase Claypool, both on contract years and the starters are a clear strength. The depth behind them stepped up at various times last year, leading to a confident 'strength' determination.

&amp;nbsp;

**TE** - Slight Strength - Kmet had a career-high 7 TDs last season and seems to be gelling with Fields. He has improved each year, but will it be enough? How will the TEs look with newly signed Robert Toynan coming off an ACL injury? While the others don't have much to show, 3 of the 4 are entering year two in the same offensive system. The coaches know how to plan with them. Adding in Marcedes Lewis for his 18th year adds the hope that his leadership will help Kmet out-preform his new 4yr/50M extension.

&amp;nbsp;

**OLine** - Neutral- This unit was automatically upgraded with the departures of Reily Reiff and Sam Mustipher. 5th rounder Braxton Jones is looking to take the next step after a tremendous rookie year. Teven Jenkins is hoping to stay healthy and cement himself as the force everyone hoped for. Whitehair can play the interior but is likely to go-to C. Davis is meant to be a solid starter and Darnell Wright is a highly touted rookie. On paper I love this unit, though until we see them play I'm not comfortable upgrading their label. 

&amp;nbsp;

**IDL** - Weakness - Look at the names. Who? Two rookies bring excitement to this unit, though one was coached into a late get-off, something he will have to strive to correct in the NFL. At the moment, this group is not inspiring. Maybe worth adding that the Bears had 20 sacks last year. Good for last in the NFL.

&amp;nbsp;

**DE** - Weakness - Arguably our worst position group at the moment. While Demarcus Walker is impressing in camp and Yannick Ngakoue is an exciting new addition, Ngakoue is also usually slighted as not being good against the run.

&amp;nbsp;

**LBs** - Strength - That is, until you look at the depth. The Bears have #9 and #10 in [PFFs](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-linebacker-rankings-2023-nfl-season) top 32 LB's ahead of the 2023 season. Sanborn seems to have cemented himself into the conversation, with a lot of fans optimistic about his long-term development.

&amp;nbsp;

**CBs** - Slight Weakness - We'll see. Jaylon Johnson needs to be better, Kyler Gordon had a rough rookie year and Tyrique Stevenson has only just joined the NFL. Reports are saying that Kyler has been doing well in camp, but we'll wait and see.

&amp;nbsp;

**Safeties** - Strength - BoJack was seeing a resurgence before getting hurt in week 12 and Brisker did a great job showing why he was a starter as a rookie. Brisker has also been selected by [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/insider/story/_/id/38149478/predicting-nfl-breakout-players-2023-season-bill-barnwell-next-stars) as a 'predicted 2023 breakout player' The depth though...

&amp;nbsp;

**Special Teams** - Neutral - Santos and Gill both outplayed their 'camp' competition early enough so they were off the roster well before this write-up was posted. That said, Gill was near the bottom in several categories during last year's rookie campaign.


&amp;nbsp;

###Schedule Predictions

&amp;nbsp;

Huge thanks to /u/HopLegion for writing the schedule prediction.

&amp;nbsp;

**1** | Packers | Sun 9/10 3:25 PM This could be the most important week 1 game the Bears have had in the last 20 years. Rodgers is gone, on paper Chicago should for the first time in 30+ years have an advantage at QB, but the Packers will own the Bears until they prove otherwise. I think this game comes down to which quarterback is better and I think Fields at home will cement himself as the better QB as Love struggles out of the gate. CHI 28 - GB 22 (1-0)

**2** | @ Buccaneers | Sun 9/17 | 12:00 PM What a difference 2 years makes for Tampa Bay. From the best QB of all time taking them to a Super Bowl to a QB competition between Baker Mayfield and Kyle Trask. This seems like a match up of a team starting its rebuild process this year versus one in year 2 of that process. I am again going with who I feel has the advantage at QB, which should be Chicago. TB 17 - CHI 23 (2-0)

**3** | Chiefs | Sun 9/24 | 3:25pm Here is where the reality check comes in for Chicago after a promising start to the season. Away in Arrowhead, I feel Mahomes still feeling angry for Chicago taking Trubisky over him decimates a young Bears defense. I expect them to take a lead early and maintain it for the entirety of the game. KC 35 - CHI 24 (2-1)

**4** | Broncos | Sun 10/1 | 12:00 pm In what should be a close game, I think is decided again by who the better QB will be. This could turn into a poor prediction, but I do think Russell Wilson bounces back this year and leads a last-minute drive to seal the victory putting the Bears on a 2 game-losing streak. CHI 21 - DEN 24 (2-2)

**5** | @ Commanders | Thurs 10/05 | 7:15 pm Chicago's first primetime game and one on short rest. Last year on Thursday night against Washington, Fields led what would have been a last-minute game-winning drive, but had 2 different receivers drop game-winning catches. I think it is actually the Bear's secondary which ends up being the difference against Howell as the Bears and Commanders' offense struggle throughout. WAS 16 - CHI 17 (3-2)

**6** | Vikings | Sun 10/15 | 12:00 pm Coming off a long rest at home against a division rival, I think this game ends up being extremely close. It wouldn't surprise me at all if it went similarly to their game a year ago almost to the day where Minnesota starts off with a big lead and Chicago comes back to take the lead midway in the 4th. This time, the double agent Ihmir Smith-Marsette who fumbled during what could have been the game-winning drive last year, is replaced by DJ Moore and the Bears win. This is the first game I'm predicting the Bears beat a team projected to have a higher win total then they do. CHI 30 - MIN 28 (4-2)

**7** | Raiders | Sun 10/22 | 12:00 PM Another winnable game at home against a team projected to have less wins than Chicago. During this point of the season, Chicago should know if Fields is the franchise QB they have been waiting for or not. This is a game the Bears should be favored in and I think they win. CHI 24 - LV 17 (5-2)

**8** | @ Chargers | Sun 10/29 | 7:20 PM Chicago's 2nd primetime game, first on Sunday Night. A chance to show if our surprising start is real or just taking advantage of a softer starting schedule. I think Chicago comes out sluggish and the Chargers on both sides of the ball end up being too much. Justin Herbert plays on the level he is paid at and one of the deeper skill groups consistently finds holes in Chicago's young defense under an offense which takes deep shots with Kellen Moore as the OC. LAC 34 - CHI 24 (5-3)

**9** | @ Saints | Sun 11/5 | 12:00pm Coming off a rough away loss, I feel Chicago will start off the game strong, but similar to the previous week a good QB in Derek Carr consistently finds weaknesses in Chicago's defense to give them a close win. Fields plays well, but can't outplay the weakness of Chicago's young defense. NO 28 - CHI 25 (5-4)

**10** | Panthers | Thu 11/09 | 7:15 PM Another short week for Chicago in primetime in what I expect to be a low-scoring affair. Carolina should have a good defense, but also what is likely going to be a bottom 5 offense. I think the trade Bears/Panthers made for the first pick was a win-win and this game will highlight that. Bryce Young will show promise, but overall Fields with the better skill group thanks to DJ Moore will come out on top in a close game. CHI 21 - CAR 19 (6-4)

**11** | @ Lions | Sun 11/20 | 12:00pm This game should be as fun as the first game DET/CHI played last year before the Bears went into full tank mode and the Lions got on a hot streak. 2 young teams hungry to prove themselves battling back and forth against underwhelming defenses. I give this one to the home team in Detroit at the same score as last year's first matchup. DET 31 - CHI 30 (6-5)

**12** | @ Vikings | Mon 11/27 | 7:15 PM Bears final primetime game (I'm sorry we're a large market and will always get at least 4), against a team I have them surprisingly beating in their first matchup. I feel the home team gets the advantage in this one, and the curse of Kirk Cousins in primetime starts to disappear. Cousins and the offense take a commanding lead and hold it throughout the entire night. MIN 28 - CHI 20 (6-6)

**13** | Bye (Finally)

**14** | Lions | Sun 12/10 12:00 PM CST Coming off a long rest at home against a team they almost beat 3 weeks ago, I have Chicago winning this one outright to stop both a 3 game-losing skid in the division and also 3 straight losses to Detroit. In a division with no clear favorite, I am expecting the more rested home team to continue to have an advantage which is the case here. CHI 25 - DET 20 (7-6)

**15** | @ Browns | Sun 12/17 | TBD This game reminds me a lot of what I previously wrote about the Broncos earlier on in the season where a former high-end QB who struggled the previous year bounces back. Beyond Watson's likely improvement this could be a game where the Brown's Dline continually takes advantage of the Bear's Oline giving Fields nightmares of his first career start CLE 28 - CHI 24 (7-7)

**16** | Cardinals | Sat 12/24 | 3:25 PM A Christmas Eve game against the team is predicted to be the worst in the league next year. A big portion of this game could come down to Kyler Murray and if he is playing at the level he was capable of prior to his injury. Overall, though I think the Cardinals are going to be doing everything they can at this point of the season to ensure they have the best draft pick possible and the Bears win more due to that than their own success. CHI 28 - ARI 17 (8-7)

**17** | Falcons | Sun 12/31 12:00 PM Following the Bear's win by their largest margin of the season and while ""in the hunt"" for the playoffs, the Bears, unfortunately, slip in a close game against the Falcons. The one thing I expect the Falcons to do well on offense is run the Ball and I am not entirely sold on the Beas D-line's ability to stop that. Mainly based behind a rushing attack the Falcons grind their way to a close win while the Bears offense falters. CHI 13 - ATL 17 (8-8)

**18** |@ Packers | 1/7 TBD What a season schedule, with the Bears beginning and ending against their hated rivals. Unfortunately for Chicago as game 1 was at home against Love in one of his first starts, this will be away at Lambeau against Love who now has almost a full season under his belt with his young offensive group. In a cold game, I'm expecting the better Oline to win and break Chicago's hopes of any postseason play. GB 27 - CHI 26 (8-9) 

&amp;nbsp;

Final record: 8-9, 3rd NFC North

&amp;nbsp;

**Some Notes**

- I only have the Bears .5 games over their current predicted over/under via Vegas Odds. While I believe Fields takes a step and solidifies himself as a franchise QB, the team is still likely too young to compete, but shows promise to take that step in 2024.
- I only have the Bears beating 2 teams predicted to have a better record than them in the Lions and the Vikings.



###Training Camp Battles

&amp;nbsp;

**IDL** - Five new faces are competing to start and cement on a place on this team as the organisation aims to move out of the rebuild.

**WR** - Darnell Mooney and Chase Claypool are both in contract years. Everyone behind them, including speedy rookie Tyler Scott, is looking to make an impact in a crowded WR room. DJ Moore is the only WR who has a contract after this season.

**RB** - Herbert, Foreman, Homer, and Johnson are all names of players who are expected to produce. Earning the lion's share is very much up for grabs.

&amp;nbsp;

###Culture and Scheme

&amp;nbsp;

Offensive Scheme: 
Gesty will continue with his [wide zone blocking scheme](https://www.ganggreennation.com/2021/10/6/22706331/wide-zone-inside-zone-and-power-gap-schemes), utilizing big, athletic lineman to help enable his creativity that can see players placed all over. Last year the offence saw 10 different WR sets and 9 different OL. With an offseason to continue building connections, the offence is expected to bring much higher levels of execution. And the back-ups, many of who are now in year two of the system, are expected to [do their job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwSlEvG0ngo), when called upon.


&amp;nbsp;

Defensive Scheme:

While the team is still building on both sides, Eberflus is a ways away from having the one-gap 4-3 defence he wants. The D-Line is by far the biggest weakness on the team. That said, he has now apparently been successful in installing his HITS ((Hustle, Intensity, Takeaways and (playing) Smart)) culture and seems to have created a culture players have bought into.

Rather than struggle to offer you some limited information about the D, I'll link to an argument from Bears reporter Robert Schmitz who does a lot of good, in-depth analysis. [In this argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/151bv1u/robert_schmitz_im_putting_flus_and_his_defensive/), he explains the defense a bit, but also illuminates his worry that Eberflus' approach is either an antique or a retrofuture defense that is ready for the modern NFL.

- Fan favourite and one of the players who has been on the team the longest, **DeAndre Houston-Carson**, is a current FA without any indication of being re-signed.

###Other Offseason News that Affected the Team

&amp;nbsp;

* Arlington Heights might be the location for the Bear's new stadium. That said they still seem to be entertaining ideas for other locations.

* To the chagrin of PETA supporters everywhere, Fields is no longer a vegan. He's shed that label to don that of a pescatarian. The world is holding its breath.

&amp;nbsp;

###Position Group Strengths &amp; Weaknesses

&amp;nbsp;

**QB** - Slight Strength - This is the year for Fields to prove to everyone he is mislabeled. His execution/decisiveness needs to improve. P.J. Walker is a solid backup and Nathan Peterman seems to be a good player/coach.

&amp;nbsp;

**RB** - Strength -  The Bears seem to be all in on the new approach to RBs, having a few guys for cheap rather than one three-down back. With several recognizable names in this group, it will likely be an RB by committee approach.

&amp;nbsp;

**WR** - Strength - D.J. Moore is an obvious upgrade. Add in Darnell Mooney and Chase Claypool, both on contract years and the starters are a clear strength. The depth behind them stepped up at various times last year, leading to a confident 'strength' determination.

&amp;nbsp;

**TE** - Slight Strength - Kmet had a career-high 7 TDs last season and seems to be gelling with Fields. He has improved each year, but will it be enough? How will the TEs look with newly signed Robert Toynan coming off an ACL injury? While the others don't have much to show, 3 of the 4 are entering year two in the same offensive system. The coaches know how to plan with them. Adding in Marcedes Lewis for his 18th year adds the hope that his leadership will help Kmet out-preform his new 4yr/50M extension.

&amp;nbsp;

**OLine** - Neutral- This unit was automatically upgraded with the departures of Reily Reiff and Sam Mustipher. 5th rounder Braxton Jones is looking to take the next step after a tremendous rookie year. Teven Jenkins is hoping to stay healthy and cement himself as the force everyone hoped for. Whitehair can play the interior but is likely to go-to C. Davis is meant to be a solid starter and Darnell Wright is a highly touted rookie. On paper I love this unit, though until we see them play I'm not comfortable upgrading their label. 

&amp;nbsp;

**IDL** - Weakness - Look at the names. Who? Two rookies bring excitement to this unit, though one was coached into a late get-off, something he will have to strive to correct in the NFL. At the moment, this group is not inspiring. Maybe worth adding that the Bears had 20 sacks last year. Good for last in the NFL.

&amp;nbsp;

**DE** - Weakness - Arguably our worst position group at the moment. While Demarcus Walker is impressing in camp and Yannick Ngakoue is an exciting new addition, Ngakoue is also usually slighted as not being good against the run.

&amp;nbsp;

**LBs** - Strength - That is, until you look at the depth. The Bears have #9 and #10 in [PFFs](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-linebacker-rankings-2023-nfl-season) top 32 LB's ahead of the 2023 season. Sanborn seems to have cemented himself into the conversation, with a lot of fans optimistic about his long-term development.

&amp;nbsp;

**CBs** - Slight Weakness - We'll see. Jaylon Johnson needs to be better, Kyler Gordon had a rough rookie year and Tyrique Stevenson has only just joined the NFL. Reports are saying that Kyler has been doing well in camp, but we'll wait and see.

&amp;nbsp;

**Safeties** - Strength - BoJack was seeing a resurgence before getting hurt in week 12 and Brisker did a great job showing why he was a starter as a rookie. Brisker has also been selected by [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/insider/story/_/id/38149478/predicting-nfl-breakout-players-2023-season-bill-barnwell-next-stars) as a 'predicted 2023 breakout player' The depth though...

&amp;nbsp;

**Special Teams** - Neutral - Santos and Gill both outplayed their 'camp' competition early enough so they were off the roster well before this write-up was posted. That said, Gill was near the bottom in several categories during last year's rookie campaign.


&amp;nbsp;

###Schedule Predictions

&amp;nbsp;

Huge thanks to /u/HopLegion for writing the schedule prediction.

&amp;nbsp;

**1** | Packers | Sun 9/10 3:25 PM This could be the most important week 1 game the Bears have had in the last 20 years. Rodgers is gone, on paper Chicago should for the first time in 30+ years have an advantage at QB, but the Packers will own the Bears until they prove otherwise. I think this game comes down to which quarterback is better and I think Fields at home will cement himself as the better QB as Love struggles out of the gate. CHI 28 - GB 22 (1-0)

**2** | @ Buccaneers | Sun 9/17 | 12:00 PM What a difference 2 years makes for Tampa Bay. From the best QB of all time taking them to a Super Bowl to a QB competition between Baker Mayfield and Kyle Trask. This seems like a match up of a team starting its rebuild process this year versus one in year 2 of that process. I am again going with who I feel has the advantage at QB, which should be Chicago. TB 17 - CHI 23 (2-0)

**3** | Chiefs | Sun 9/24 | 3:25pm Here is where the reality check comes in for Chicago after a promising start to the season. Away in Arrowhead, I feel Mahomes still feeling angry for Chicago taking Trubisky over him decimates a young Bears defense. I expect them to take a lead early and maintain it for the entirety of the game. KC 35 - CHI 24 (2-1)

**4** | Broncos | Sun 10/1 | 12:00 pm In what should be a close game, I think is decided again by who the better QB will be. This could turn into a poor prediction, but I do think Russell Wilson bounces back this year and leads a last-minute drive to seal the victory putting the Bears on a 2 game-losing streak. CHI 21 - DEN 24 (2-2)

**5** | @ Commanders | Thurs 10/05 | 7:15 pm Chicago's first primetime game and one on short rest. Last year on Thursday night against Washington, Fields led what would have been a last-minute game-winning drive, but had 2 different receivers drop game-winning catches. I think it is actually the Bear's secondary which ends up being the difference against Howell as the Bears and Commanders' offense struggle throughout. WAS 16 - CHI 17 (3-2)

**6** | Vikings | Sun 10/15 | 12:00 pm Coming off a long rest at home against a division rival, I think this game ends up being extremely close. It wouldn't surprise me at all if it went similarly to their game a year ago almost to the day where Minnesota starts off with a big lead and Chicago comes back to take the lead midway in the 4th. This time, the double agent Ihmir Smith-Marsette who fumbled during what could have been the game-winning drive last year, is replaced by DJ Moore and the Bears win. This is the first game I'm predicting the Bears beat a team projected to have a higher win total then they do. CHI 30 - MIN 28 (4-2)

**7** | Raiders | Sun 10/22 | 12:00 PM Another winnable game at home against a team projected to have less wins than Chicago. During this point of the season, Chicago should know if Fields is the franchise QB they have been waiting for or not. This is a game the Bears should be favored in and I think they win. CHI 24 - LV 17 (5-2)

**8** | @ Chargers | Sun 10/29 | 7:20 PM Chicago's 2nd primetime game, first on Sunday Night. A chance to show if our surprising start is real or just taking advantage of a softer starting schedule. I think Chicago comes out sluggish and the Chargers on both sides of the ball end up being too much. Justin Herbert plays on the level he is paid at and one of the deeper skill groups consistently finds holes in Chicago's young defense under an offense which takes deep shots with Kellen Moore as the OC. LAC 34 - CHI 24 (5-3)

**9** | @ Saints | Sun 11/5 | 12:00pm Coming off a rough away loss, I feel Chicago will start off the game strong, but similar to the previous week a good QB in Derek Carr consistently finds weaknesses in Chicago's defense to give them a close win. Fields plays well, but can't outplay the weakness of Chicago's young defense. NO 28 - CHI 25 (5-4)

**10** | Panthers | Thu 11/09 | 7:15 PM Another short week for Chicago in primetime in what I expect to be a low-scoring affair. Carolina should have a good defense, but also what is likely going to be a bottom 5 offense. I think the trade Bears/Panthers made for the first pick was a win-win and this game will highlight that. Bryce Young will show promise, but overall Fields with the better skill group thanks to DJ Moore will come out on top in a close game. CHI 21 - CAR 19 (6-4)

**11** | @ Lions | Sun 11/20 | 12:00pm This game should be as fun as the first game DET/CHI played last year before the Bears went into full tank mode and the Lions got on a hot streak. 2 young teams hungry to prove themselves battling back and forth against underwhelming defenses. I give this one to the home team in Detroit at the same score as last year's first matchup. DET 31 - CHI 30 (6-5)

**12** | @ Vikings | Mon 11/27 | 7:15 PM Bears final primetime game (I'm sorry we're a large market and will always get at least 4), against a team I have them surprisingly beating in their first matchup. I feel the home team gets the advantage in this one, and the curse of Kirk Cousins in primetime starts to disappear. Cousins and the offense take a commanding lead and hold it throughout the entire night. MIN 28 - CHI 20 (6-6)

**13** | Bye (Finally)

**14** | Lions | Sun 12/10 12:00 PM CST Coming off a long rest at home against a team they almost beat 3 weeks ago, I have Chicago winning this one outright to stop both a 3 game-losing skid in the division and also 3 straight losses to Detroit. In a division with no clear favorite, I am expecting the more rested home team to continue to have an advantage which is the case here. CHI 25 - DET 20 (7-6)

**15** | @ Browns | Sun 12/17 | TBD This game reminds me a lot of what I previously wrote about the Broncos earlier on in the season where a former high-end QB who struggled the previous year bounces back. Beyond Watson's likely improvement this could be a game where the Brown's Dline continually takes advantage of the Bear's Oline giving Fields nightmares of his first career start CLE 28 - CHI 24 (7-7)

**16** | Cardinals | Sat 12/24 | 3:25 PM A Christmas Eve game against the team is predicted to be the worst in the league next year. A big portion of this game could come down to Kyler Murray and if he is playing at the level he was capable of prior to his injury. Overall, though I think the Cardinals are going to be doing everything they can at this point of the season to ensure they have the best draft pick possible and the Bears win more due to that than their own success. CHI 28 - ARI 17 (8-7)

**17** | Falcons | Sun 12/31 12:00 PM Following the Bear's win by their largest margin of the season and while ""in the hunt"" for the playoffs, the Bears, unfortunately, slip in a close game against the Falcons. The one thing I expect the Falcons to do well on offense is run the Ball and I am not entirely sold on the Beas D-line's ability to stop that. Mainly based behind a rushing attack the Falcons grind their way to a close win while the Bears offense falters. CHI 13 - ATL 17 (8-8)

**18** |@ Packers | 1/7 TBD What a season schedule, with the Bears beginning and ending against their hated rivals. Unfortunately for Chicago as game 1 was at home against Love in one of his first starts, this will be away at Lambeau against Love who now has almost a full season under his belt with his young offensive group. In a cold game, I'm expecting the better Oline to win and break Chicago's hopes of any postseason play. GB 27 - CHI 26 (8-9) 

&amp;nbsp;

Final record: 8-9, 3rd NFC North

&amp;nbsp;

**Some Notes**

- I only have the Bears .5 games over their current predicted over/under via Vegas Odds. While I believe Fields takes a step and solidifies himself as a franchise QB, the team is still likely too young to compete, but shows promise to take that step in 2024.
- I only have the Bears beating 2 teams predicted to have a better record than them in the Lions and the Vikings.



###Training Camp Battles

&amp;nbsp;

**IDL** - Five new faces are competing to start and cement on a place on this team as the organisation aims to move out of the rebuild.

**WR** - Darnell Mooney and Chase Claypool are both in contract years. Everyone behind them, including speedy rookie Tyler Scott, is looking to make an impact in a crowded WR room. DJ Moore is the only WR who has a contract after this season.

**RB** - Herbert, Foreman, Homer, and Johnson are all names of players who are expected to produce. Earning the lion's share is very much up for grabs.

&amp;nbsp;

###Culture and Scheme

&amp;nbsp;

Offensive Scheme: 
Gesty will continue with his [wide zone blocking scheme](https://www.ganggreennation.com/2021/10/6/22706331/wide-zone-inside-zone-and-power-gap-schemes), utilizing big, athletic lineman to help enable his creativity that can see players placed all over. Last year the offence saw 10 different WR sets and 9 different OL. With an offseason to continue building connections, the offence is expected to bring much higher levels of execution. And the back-ups, many of who are now in year two of the system, are expected to [do their job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwSlEvG0ngo), when called upon.


&amp;nbsp;

Defensive Scheme:

While the team is still building on both sides, Eberflus is a ways away from having the one-gap 4-3 defence he wants. The D-Line is by far the biggest weakness on the team. That said, he has now apparently been successful in installing his HITS ((Hustle, Intensity, Takeaways and (playing) Smart)) culture and seems to have created a culture players have bought into.

Rather than struggle to offer you some limited information about the D, I'll link to an argument from Bears reporter Robert Schmitz who does a lot of good, in-depth analysis. [In this argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/151bv1u/robert_schmitz_im_putting_flus_and_his_defensive/), he explains the defense a bit, but also illuminates his worry that Eberflus' approach is either an antique or a retrofuture defense that is ready for the modern NFL.

- 10) Bucs upset the Eagles in the 2002 NFCCG

- 9) Tuck Rule

- 8) Favre throws devastating INTs in multiple NFCCGs, for both the Packers and Vikings.

- 7) Music City Miracle

- 6) Bills erase a 32-point deficit against the Oilers in the AFC Wild Card round (would stand as largest comeback in NFL History until Vikings/Colts last year)

- 5) Butler Pick

- 4) Steelers put a miracle drive together to beat the Cardinals in the Super Bowl.

- 3) Wide Right

- 2) Browns Back-to-back losses to the Broncos in 1986 and 1987 - ""The Drive"" and ""The Fumble""

- 1) Patriots falling short of perfection

Do you guys think this is a good list, or have new things since happen that deserve to replace current entries? Have there been any more devastating losses since 2015, or maybe just ones that were overlooked at the time?"

AFL Vs NFL Championships,nfl,"We know they started the first few super bowls to see which leagues champ would win. We know how that went (basically 2-2 before the merger)

1960 Houston vs Philly
1961 Houston vs Green Bay
1962 Dallas vs Green Bay
1963 San Diego vs Chicago
1964 Buffalo vs Cleveland
1965 Buffalo vs Green Bay

And here is where it fell apart. It’s certainly not fair to pit them against one another the first few years as the AFL was fledgling and not working off the same talent pool. So that’s out. 

And as nice as Buffalo was for two years I just don’t think I can find analysis to talk myself into them beating Jim Brown and Lombardis boys. 

But (and this was actually what started the idea) 1963. San Diego Vs Chicago. 

San Diego had one of the most prolific offenses that year. They matched up with the Patriots, who had the most menacing defense…and they literally kicked the living shit out of Boston.

https://preview.redd.it/p8wmfqf4dbhb1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dc136e09705eec767d50b1e28a23c720b9ca749

&amp;#x200B;

It’s that time of the year again! After going through the extensive exercise of ranking the top 20+ players at every single position in the NFL today, I combined those to create a list of the 100 best in the game heading into this upcoming season, regardless of position.

The player’s list is one of my favorite things to watch every year, but the process is inherently flawed, since the voters only fill in their top-20 names and are tempted to prop up their teammates or even list themselves. Some of the guys near the bottom shouldn’t be on anybody’s top-20 ballot if they’re being objective.

What’s important to understand is that I’m trying to isolate the individual players, rather than judging their value to their respective teams or how good they may be in a specific role. So not while I bring up general statistics, but also give you background on studying the game’s best and try to draw a bow between both those worlds with some advanced metrics, in order to add context.

Before we get to the actual list, here are a few players who I considered ineligible due to missing time with injury in the past or expected to not be available for a certain amount of games in 2023 – Kyler Murray, Matt Stafford, Alvin Kamara, Calvin Ridley, Darren Waller, Harold Landry, J.C. Jackson and Micah Hyde.

### 

### 1. Patrick Mahomes

I’m feeling very similar about Mahomes as I did with Aaron Rodgers in the early 2010s, when you could really put him atop the list every single year. People – including me – will try to be fancy/different and make cases for other names, but I don’t believe you can say since this guy took over for Alex Smith in 2018, anybody has been more valuable to his team than Pat. Last season he easily had the top mark among quarterbacks in EPA per play. He’s only finished worse than second once across his five seasons as a starter – and that was at third in 2020. The Houdini-like plays are what catches everybody’s eye, to where people don’t appreciate how he can dice up defenses within structure as well. Plus, his toughness and drive are off the charts, as we saw when he defeated the most-loaded roster in the league on a bummed-up ankle for his second ring.

&amp;#x200B;

### 2. Justin Jefferson

Just on the surface, Jefferson obviously led the NFL in receptions (128), yards (1809) and 1st downs through the air (80). You can argue his quarterback Kirk Cousins had a career year and the passing game overall was the most well-designed since Jefferson got there, but I don’t believe even more well-versed fans understand how much this guy carried that unit. Looking at yards per route run (which Jefferson finished behind only Tyreek Hill among players with 50+ targets at 2.55 per), the only Viking higher than 166th in that metric last season was T.J. Hockenson, who didn’t get traded to Minnesota until the second half of the year – and even then, his number fell off. This dude can absolutely destroy DBs in man-coverage, displays high football IQ working against zone and understands how to manipulate the safety when bracketed, his ability to evade contact as a route-runner is impeccable, yet then he also hauled in 22 of 40 contested targets.

&amp;#x200B;

### 3. Nick Bosa

It didn’t take the second overall pick from the 2019 NFL Draft very long to make his presence known in the pros, as he set what still easily is the top mark in defensive pressures by a rookie (80) since the inception of PFF. After being lost with injury in the second week of his encore season, he’s been one of the elite edge defenders in football these last two years, ascending to apex predator status in 2022. Not only did Bosa lead the NFL with 18.5 sacks, but he also racked up 12 more QB hits than any other player in the league (48) and only Maxx Crosby recorded more than Bosa’s 19 tackles for loss. That’s even more impressive considering he played just under 70% of defensive snaps for San Francisco. And when you look at their pass-rush win rate with or without #97, it’s pretty drastic.

&amp;#x200B;

### 4. Josh Allen

The term “force of nature” I believe encapsulates best what type of player Allen is. He finished head and shoulders above the rest of the competition with his 52 big-time throws (compared to Mahomes’ 38), yet he also led the Bills in yards per rush (6.1), 1st downs (55) and touchdowns on the ground (7). Early on last season, it looked like he was unstoppable, because he started getting to his checkdowns and pick apart defenses trying to take away the deep ball, but once he injured the elbow on his throwing arm, the average depth of target actually increased substantially, because without precision accuracy, the payoff wasn’t worth the risk associated with high-volume underneath passing. With that being said, he will need to take better care of the ball in the red-zone. I believe we saw a healthy Allen become more efficient in those areas again, whilst still having the most lethal arm (strength) in football and killing defenses with his legs, as his 9.4 yards per scramble was second to only Justin Fields (9.6) among QBs with 10+ attempts.

&amp;#x200B;

### 5. Travis Kelce

Something Danny Heifetz of the Ringer’s Fantasy Football Show loves to bring up – the difference between having Kelce in half-PPR formats compared to the number two tight-end (T.J. Hockenson) was the same as the difference between that guy and TE22. He’s a cheat-code in all fantasy formats, but he’s even more frustrating to deal with for defenses in real life. No pass-catcher was responsible for more 1st downs (78) and touchdowns (12) last season than Kelce, with 90 total, finishing second in both categories. That’s despite seeing 32 and 28 fewer targets than the respective leaders among those marks. His ability to manipulate any man-defender with body-language and untraditional movements during the route or punish any voids left in zone coverage are immaculate. The implicit chemistry between him and Mahomes is hard to even verbalize, but it’s been a huge reason Kansas City has finished top-three in 3rd-down conversion rate each of the five years they’ve worked together.

&amp;#x200B;

### 6. Myles Garrett

With Nick Bosa missing almost all of 2020 and T.J. Watt being at full strength for half of this past season at best, you can easily make an argument that Garrett has been the best edge defender in football over the last three years. In 2022, he actually “fell” to second-team All-Pro after a couple of 1st-team nods, in large part because the Browns were in the bottom-quarter of the league in rushing yards average and total, which led to fewer favorable true pass-rush opportunities. However, he received the highest overall PFF grade (92.5) and pass-rush grade (93.5) among all defensive players in the NFL, along with being tied for fourth in TFLs (18). While I believe Garrett’s run defense is underappreciated, it’s how much more bendy he’s become and his ability to move across them line in passing situations that have made him a menace to block. That’s how he’s tied with T.J. Watt for the highest sack-per-game rate in NFL history (0.89).

&amp;#x200B;

### 7. Chris Jones

Since I just mentioned him, Myles Garrett was the only defensive player in the NFL with a higher overall PFF grade (92.3) than Jones, between week one and the Super Bowl. While I don’t believe he’ll ever be quite as dominant against the run as Aaron Donald has been, I thought he became a lot more impactful near the point of attack this past season and he was tied for seventh among all defensive players in TFLs (17). More importantly, looking at the PFF database, Jones’ 97 total pressures were 27(!) more than the next-closest interior defensive lineman, if you include the playoffs. The fact he put up the highest pass-rush win rate among interior D-linemen (20.2%) and 11 of his 15.5 sacks ended opposing drives is even more impressive considering he was double-teamed at the highest rate in the league (69%). He’s become a true closer for the league’s most dominant team.

&amp;#x200B;

### 8. Trent Williams

The only reason Trent isn’t considered an all-time great like Joe Thomas was (yet), entering the league three years later, is that he missed 29 games between 2016 and 2019 – which the last of those he sat out entirely. In three years with the 49ers, he has been the highest-graded offensive tackle in PFF’s database in each of those. That was the case in two other years in Washington (2013 and 2016). Williams has to be the scariest man to step in front of in the run game, where he can drive guys out to the sideline, cave in one side entirely for cutback lanes or make the knees of defenders shake when he gets out in space. Along with that, he has held opposing pass-rushers to just one sack each of the last two seasons and 61 total pressures across 1708 pass-blocking snaps these prior three years.

&amp;#x200B;

### 9. Aaron Donald

Even though Donald is coming off by far his least productive season as a pro, I could not ignore the resume of this all-time great and drop his outside the top-ten. Even if you just go by traditional statistics, his 103 sacks and 160 TFLs across 138 career games, that puts him into a league of his own as far interior D-linemen go. However, in four of the five seasons prior to 2022, he cracked at least 102 combined pressures, including the playoffs. Only Tamba Hali, J.J. Watt, Za’Darius Smith, Maxx Crosby and Micah Parsons have reached that number since PFF started tracking those back in 2006 – and they all only did it once each. However, that should not overshadow the type of disruption Donald creates in the run game, where his first step combined insane strength around 280 pounds constantly messes up plays. In fact, he has received an overall grade of over 90 in all nine of his seasons as a pro.

&amp;#x200B;

### 10. Joe Burrow

This guy is an absolute killer. I actually made a video on why the Bengals offense struggled during their 0-2 start to last season, but once they made the fundamental shift to a more 11-personnel heavy, spread approach, they became one of the most efficient offenses in the NFL (second behind only the Chiefs in EPA per play from week six onwards). Even with Ja’Marr Chase missing some time and the supposedly improved O-line having issues in protection for stretches, Joey B was able to finish behind only Mahomes with 279.7 passing yards per game and 35 TDs through the air, whilst being tied for the second-lowest time-to-throw (2.5 seconds). While the Bengals were probably one mental mistake in Kansas City away from going to back-to-back Super Bowl, after beating up the Bills at their place, Burrow himself was tied with Mahomes for the highest PFF grade (92.0), with the best big-time-throw (37) to turnover-worthy play (18) rate among the three (2.06-to-one).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/71fr7c2cdbhb1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e2cad374ac10fc637c297fdec63c84a08b2447

&amp;#x200B;

### 11. Micah Parsons

As Parsons has transitioned from off-ball backer all the way back to defensive end coming into 2023 – which Penn State originally recruited him as – he’s turned himself into one of the toughest guys to block in all of football. According to PFF, Micah led the NFL with 106 total pressures (across 577 pass-rush snaps) if you include the playoffs, and his 19.3% pressure rate was first as well. Not only has he made 1st-team All-Pro and finished second in DPOY voting each of his first two seasons, but he also joined Reggie White and Aldon Smith as the only three players with 13+ sacks in consecutive years to begin their careers. His speed off the edge is too much to handle for most NFL tackles, but he’s improved his ability to defeat their hands and the power he can convert that initial burst into shocks most opponents. He’s also uber-active in the run game, as somebody constantly fighting off contact and too fast to leave unblocked on the backside, while he forced three fumbles this past season.

&amp;#x200B;

### 12. Tyreek Hill

Until the last couple of weeks of the 2022 season, Hill was actually head-to-head with Justin Jefferson and if he didn’t lose QB1, he might’ve actually had those extra 100 yards he needed for the receiving crown (1710 yards). However, while those two actually shared almost the exact same target share around 40%, Tyreek was the only pass-catcher with 20+ targets to average at least three yards per route run (3.07 – about half a yard more than Jefferson). What’s crazy about that, is the fact that Miami actually didn’t set him up with a ton of run-after-catch opportunities, with hole-shots off wheel routes off motion and several deep balls chucked his way, where he actually needed to stop and work back towards the ball, making his 50% contested catch rate at 5’10” even more impressive. You watch the Ravens and Lions games – in which he put up 190 and 188 yards respectively – and this dude almost single-handedly earned them those wins, when everybody knew that’s where they were going in key spots.

&amp;#x200B;

### 13. Fred Warner

Fans of the linebacker position had the luxury of watching perennial All-Pros Luke Kuechly and Bobby Wagner during the 2010s, along with the tail-end of the Patrick Willis-NaVorro Bowman tandem. Well, since then a new alpha on the second level has separated himself from the rest of the pack in San Francisco. Fred Warner’s numbers across 86 career games are certainly impressive – 634 total tackles, four INTs, 35 PBUs, seven forced fumbles and 30 combined sacks and QB hits. However, it’s his impact on games that you can’t express in numbers that make him truly special – how he forces running backs to redirect because of how quickly he fills on the front-side, how he splits a couple of blockers to shut down screen passes, how he’s mugged up in the A-gap and is still able to carry the slot receiver 40 yards down the seams. His play speed is absolutely insane and just watching games, his presence is constantly felt. He’s also missed just 6.2% of his attempted tackles since 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

### 14. T.J. Watt

After a monster start in week one against the Bengals, when he had a sack, QB hit, three TFLs and an interception, Watt suffered a torn bicep at the end of the game and ended up missing a couple of months. He never quite returned to form, but we can’t forget what kind of insane path this guy has been on. Even with that injury-plagued 2022 campaign, Watt still has the most sacks (77.5), QB hits (162), and forced fumbles (23) since entering the league in 2017. He’s capable of taking over games in a hurry, but it’s his steady presence and effort to consistently affect the run and pass game that make him one of the game’s best. Looking at his impact when Watt was on the field this past season, the Steelers defense allowed 16.9 points per game and had 3.2 sacks per game (8-1 record). Without him, it allowed 25.3 points and had just 1.1 sacks (1-6 record).

&amp;#x200B;

### 15. Patrick Surtain II

As I’ve said before, if you’re looking at the job description of a cornerback, in terms of sticking to your man and not allowing him to catch passes, I believe Surtain has ascended to the top of the list. He earned the second-highest PFF grade in coverage (86.7) to only rookie sensation Sauce Gardner and while the raw numbers for opposing QBs targeting him (45-of-77 for 468 yards and four TDs vs. two INTs) don’t scream out lockdown corner to you, I believe context is needed. Unlike most teams today who either leave their guys on respective sides and/or play different variations of match-zone coverages, Pat II is legitimately isolated with the opposing team’s top outside receiver every week and the Broncos structure their defense around him. Watch his two matchups against Davante Adams last season, where he was all over the All-Pro receiver until the very last play of their overtime game, when because Josh McDaniels understood what kind of student of the game he was, they got him on a double-move off one of their staple concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

### 16. Zack Martin

I was shocked to find out Martin finished all the way down at 50th among all offensive linemen who played 100+ snaps last season in terms of PFF grade. Considering he didn’t allow a single sack, just two QB hits and 15 additional pressures on over 700 pass-blocking snaps, that had me scratching my head even more so. The reasoning behind it was a run-blocking grade of 63.7, which I just disagree with, considering he and his fellow linemen regularly placed defensive linemen in the laps of linebackers and guys never seem to disengage from him once he’s been able to latch his hands. Martin has now made 1st-team All-Pro six times and second-time twice, with the only year he didn’t reach either being 2020, when he played a career-low ten games (only one other time did he not reach at least 16 starts).

&amp;#x200B;

### 17. Ja’Marr Chase

After setting the NFL record for rookie receiving yards in 2021, Chase was still able to affect the 12 games he was available for in equal fashion. Seeing six more targets his way (134) and catching all of those (87), he was able to convert 50% of his targets and 77% of his receptions into either 1st downs or touchdowns. The amount of big plays (13 catches of 20+ yards) certainly decreased, but he was an even more reliable piece in key situations, as only Detroit’s Amon-Ra St. Brown converted more 3rd downs per game into 1st downs (1.42) among pass-catchers with 50+ targets. He can run by pretty much anybody and looks even faster with the ball in his hands, but he’s worked on his craft, in order to come open at the marker and find space along the sideline for crucial grabs. And acrossed 15 total games played (including playoffs), he finished below 50 yards just once. The one issue – he led the NFL with 0.92 drops per game (11 total).

&amp;#x200B;

### 18. Davante Adams

While Adams’ yards per game decreased to “only” 89.2 last season (still top-five), he led the NFL in receiving TDs for the second time in his career with 14. That’s despite being part of a Raiders offense that other than him and Josh Jacobs didn’t have any consistent producers among their skill-position group. If you put in perspective how much Davante meant for that unit, he not only accounted for half of their scoring through the air, but also second behind only D.J. Moore as part of a horrible Panthers offense, in the percentage share of his team’s air yardage (41.8%). However, while he was still a chain-mover for the Silver and Black, he was used downfield more than he ever in his career, as his 10.2 yards before the catch on average was just 0.1 yard behind Tyreek Hill and his 24 receptions of 20+ yards was just one behind the Miami speedster. That included a walk-off touchdown in overtime in their second Broncos game.

&amp;#x200B;

### 19. Lane Johnson

Really to express how freaking good Lane has been over these last few years, all I need to say is that he hasn’t allowed a sack since week 11 of 2020. He’s also only allowed one QB hit, despite spending over 1100 snaps in pass-pro since then and having faced some of the top-flight pass-rushers across the league. Johnson isn’t quite up to par with the brute force of his counterpart Jordan Mailata over at left tackle or as versatile in his usage as Jason Kelce at center, but he’s able to control and steer bodies in the run game, while his guy never seems to make the tackle. Johnson is the best pure pass-protector in the game today and got the job every week for the most devastating rushing attack in the NFL, as they led the league in total yards (3040) if you include the playoffs and set a new record with 42(!) TDs on the ground for a season.

&amp;#x200B;

### 20. Maxx Crosby

You need convincing that Crosby is one of the premiere defensive linemen in the game or just want to have fun for the next hour? Go put on some Raiders tape and watch this man go to work – please don’t pay attention to the rest of that defense though. Somehow because he’s this big white dude, people act like Crosby isn’t an above-90th percentile athlete for the position, yet he plays harder than anybody as physically gifted as he is. He’s not the most diverse pass-rusher, but his ability to put tackles of their heels and then throw in a spin move a couple of times per game gets the job done. According to PFF, his 189 total pressures over the last two years lead all defensive players, despite being on a below-average defenses and not having any playoff games to expand that number. Yet, he’s also hyper-active in the run game, to work off blocks and track down the ball-carrier, which is how he had three more tackles for loss (22) than any other player in the NFL, along with three forced fumbles.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/df1yt63ddbhb1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=291e7629ef318249d9e1582df4e9ee38a3672de1

&amp;#x200B;

### 21. Christian McCaffrey

After combining for just ten games the two years prior, McCaffrey was able to finally play a full 17 plus playoffs again in 2022. However, I believe to express how insane he is on a real offense – not the Panthers, who were literally dead-last in the NFL through the first six weeks, when the star running back was still there – we have to look at what he did as a member of the 49ers. Across 14 games and 263 touches for Kyle Shanahan, CMac racked up 1509 yards and 13 TDs from scrimmage, plus another passing TD. You could tell he ran with a different attitude once he got to San Francisco and him as another movable piece for that skill-position group almost seems unfair. Despite seeing the second-highest target share among running backs to only Austin Ekeler, Niner QBs had a passer rating of 115.5 when going McCaffrey’s way.

&amp;#x200B;

### 22. Chris Lindstrom

With the surprising fall of Quenton Nelson and the rest of the Colts offensive line, a new challenger to the Cowboys’ Zack Martin for the title of best guard in football emerged. Lindstrom received easily the highest PFF grade among offensive linemen (95.0), in particular without another interior guy quite cracking the 90-mark. His ability to create lateral displacement on the front-side of zone concepts, get to the outside edge of defenders in order to scoop them up away from the point of attack and take linebackers for a ride when he snatches them up was a huge factor in the Falcons finishing just two yards short of second in rushing yards (2718) and just outside the top-three in terms of yards per rush (4.9), despite having very inconsistent QB play to keep defenses from stacking the box. And while Lindstrom isn’t put in a ton of true dropbacks, with the league’s highest rate of RPOs (28.9% of pass attempts), only allowing nine total pressures across 517 pass-blocking snaps is highly impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

### 23. Minkah Fitzpatrick

This marks the second time in three years that Minkah finds himself atop my safety rankings on one of these lists and you almost can’t deny he’s become one of the games’ greats, earning his third 1st-team All-Pro nod in four years with the Steelers. Even with a couple of games missed due to injury, he was tied for a league-high six INTs, along with 11 more PBUs. However, he’s far from a finesse free safety. This guy can be an enforcer dropping as a robber or when you try to hit seam routes/benders against him in two-high shells. 2022 marked the second straight year with a run defense grade of over 82 for him and he missed a career-low 5.0% of his tackling attempts. Other than maybe Derwin James, he’s the most useful safety, but at the same time his knack for the ball also makes him the most dangerous one.

&amp;#x200B;

### 24. Sauce Gardner

Not enough is made of how rare it is for rookie cornerbacks to even be above-average starters, much less play at an All-Pro level. However, not only did Sauce win Defensive Rookie of the Year, but the Associated Press also named him 1st-team for how consistent he was all season, as he was tied for the best PFF coverage grade among all defensive backs (90.0). Along with his two interceptions, he led the league with 20 more passes broken up, despite only seeing 86 targets come his way. 46 of those got completed for 452 yards and one touchdown – which was actually on him based on their rules in zone coverage, but he was labelled the next-closest defender. With as zone-heavy as the Jets defensive system is, they ask their corners to help a lot in run support and Sauce didn’t back down at all as a tackler, missing just five of 80 attempts on the year.

&amp;#x200B;

### 25. Justin Herbert

Just looking at the total numbers, not only did Herbert set the all-time record for passing yards and touchdowns through year one and two, but he’s also sixth ever in TD-to-INT ratio (2.69). This past season despite losing his All-Pro left tackle mid-way through week three, Mike Williams and Keenan Allen missing 11 combined games, the team averaging just 3.8 yards per rush and Herbert fracturing his rib cartilage in week two already, he was able to throw 26 TDs compared to ten picks and lead the Chargers to ten wins. He finished tied for 31st in intended air yards per pass attempt due to the restrictions of the Joe Lombardi passing game, with so many static, repetitive concepts with no vertical stretching of defenses and very limited space created for run-after-catch opportunities. Putting statistical context to the tape, which shows how many bad plays he gets L.A. out of, he put up the fifth-lowest pressure-to-sack conversion rate (14.2%).

&amp;#x200B;

### 26. Nick Chubb

Chubb “only” finished third in total rushing yards last season (1525), but he also received 37 and 47 fewer carries than numbers one and two. He led the NFL with 47 rushes of 10+ yards and had the best missed tackle forced-per-carry rate at 27.5%. Yes, he operates behind one of the best offensive lines in football, but his ability to make those big guys look good with appropriate pacing, manipulation of 1st- or 2nd-level defenders and to get skinny for a nearly 230-pound back is tremendous. He squats about three times his weight, which shows up in the way he clears arm-tackles like turnstiles and is able to churn out yardage when he is actually wrapped up. The only reason he isn’t considered among the elite by everybody is his limited usage in the pass game, but he does average 6.3 yards per target for his career, despite a yards-before-catch average mark of -0.6. By the way, he just became the first running back ever to average at least five yards per carry for five straight years – which is as long as he’s been in the league.

&amp;#x200B;

### 27. Dexter Lawrence

I know nose-tackle isn’t the sexiest position for casual NFL fans, but we need to appreciate how dominant Sexy Dexy was in 2022. Only Myles Garrett received a higher PFF grade during the regular season (92.4) among all defensive players in the league and I would argue Lawrence was the most impactful player in New York’s first playoff win since 2011, as he abused the Vikings interior O-line throughout the day. Despite spending about two thirds of snaps between the guards, Lawrence finished second to only Chris Jones among interior defenders with 70 total pressures. Taking the playoffs into account, he was tied for sixth among all defensive linemen with 32 run stops, yet only missed just one of 69 tackling attempts. His ability to control guys on the inside one-on-one, swallow combos and take pass-blockers on the inside for a ride set up one of the most dominant seasons we’ve seen from a legit nose.

&amp;#x200B;

### 28. Quinnen Williams

While personnel-wise the Jets secondary experienced the biggest overhaul heading into this past year, their dramatic shift from dead-last to top-five across basically all defensive statistics can be equally connected to the ascent of Williams as a true difference-maker up front. While he had been an impactful starter his first three years with Gang Green, the former number three overall pick finally lived up to my lofty expectations for him coming out of Alabama. For the 2022 regular season, Big Q’s pressure-per-pass-rush-snap rate of 12.9% put him behind only Javon Hargrave and Chris Jones in terms of interior defensive linemen, while pro-football-reference has him tied for second with 28 QB hits. Despite only spending 270 snaps in run-defense (36th for his position) due to the heavy rotation New York uses, he was able to throw off plays before they could even get going with regularity and finished tied for sixth among that group with 12 TFLs.

&amp;#x200B;

### 29. Stefon Diggs

Even with Gabriel Davis being expected to break out in 2022 and QB Josh Allen banging up his elbow mid-way through the year, it didn’t really slow down Diggs’ production in in his eighth season, as he set personal highs in 1st downs (74) and TDs responsible for (11). Looking at his numbers among all wide receivers, he finished top-five in receiving yards (1429), 1st downs per receptions (46.8%) and passer rating when targeted (120.3). While he can still win down the field with tremendous focus and ball-skills (finished behind only Tyreek Hill and Davante Adams with six catches of 40+ yards), it’s his ability to win early in the route that have made him one of the most efficient high-volume targets across the league. With that being said, he was only tied for 18th in catches that converted 3rd downs (16), had a career-worst contested catch rate of just 46.2% (which is still pretty damn good) and he was tied for the tenth-most drops across the league (nine).

&amp;#x200B;",t5_2qmg3,34667,5375,"Halil’s NFL Top 100 Players of 2023:&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p8wmfqf4dbhb1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dc136e09705eec767d50b1e28a23c720b9ca749

&amp;#x200B;

It’s that time of the year again! After going through the extensive exercise of ranking the top 20+ players at every single position in the NFL today, I combined those to create a list of the 100 best in the game heading into this upcoming season, regardless of position.

The player’s list is one of my favorite things to watch every year, but the process is inherently flawed, since the voters only fill in their top-20 names and are tempted to prop up their teammates or even list themselves. Some of the guys near the bottom shouldn’t be on anybody’s top-20 ballot if they’re being objective.

What’s important to understand is that I’m trying to isolate the individual players, rather than judging their value to their respective teams or how good they may be in a specific role. So not while I bring up general statistics, but also give you background on studying the game’s best and try to draw a bow between both those worlds with some advanced metrics, in order to add context.

Before we get to the actual list, here are a few players who I considered ineligible due to missing time with injury in the past or expected to not be available for a certain amount of games in 2023 – Kyler Murray, Matt Stafford, Alvin Kamara, Calvin Ridley, Darren Waller, Harold Landry, J.C. Jackson and Micah Hyde.  


&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gi1s8igadbhb1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a33c246b902f66e999ee98531965825f9db56271

### 

### 1. Patrick Mahomes

I’m feeling very similar about Mahomes as I did with Aaron Rodgers in the early 2010s, when you could really put him atop the list every single year. People – including me – will try to be fancy/different and make cases for other names, but I don’t believe you can say since this guy took over for Alex Smith in 2018, anybody has been more valuable to his team than Pat. Last season he easily had the top mark among quarterbacks in EPA per play. He’s only finished worse than second once across his five seasons as a starter – and that was at third in 2020. The Houdini-like plays are what catches everybody’s eye, to where people don’t appreciate how he can dice up defenses within structure as well. Plus, his toughness and drive are off the charts, as we saw when he defeated the most-loaded roster in the league on a bummed-up ankle for his second ring.

&amp;#x200B;

### 2. Justin Jefferson

Just on the surface, Jefferson obviously led the NFL in receptions (128), yards (1809) and 1st downs through the air (80). You can argue his quarterback Kirk Cousins had a career year and the passing game overall was the most well-designed since Jefferson got there, but I don’t believe even more well-versed fans understand how much this guy carried that unit. Looking at yards per route run (which Jefferson finished behind only Tyreek Hill among players with 50+ targets at 2.55 per), the only Viking higher than 166th in that metric last season was T.J. Hockenson, who didn’t get traded to Minnesota until the second half of the year – and even then, his number fell off. This dude can absolutely destroy DBs in man-coverage, displays high football IQ working against zone and understands how to manipulate the safety when bracketed, his ability to evade contact as a route-runner is impeccable, yet then he also hauled in 22 of 40 contested targets.

&amp;#x200B;

### 3. Nick Bosa

It didn’t take the second overall pick from the 2019 NFL Draft very long to make his presence known in the pros, as he set what still easily is the top mark in defensive pressures by a rookie (80) since the inception of PFF. After being lost with injury in the second week of his encore season, he’s been one of the elite edge defenders in football these last two years, ascending to apex predator status in 2022. Not only did Bosa lead the NFL with 18.5 sacks, but he also racked up 12 more QB hits than any other player in the league (48) and only Maxx Crosby recorded more than Bosa’s 19 tackles for loss. That’s even more impressive considering he played just under 70% of defensive snaps for San Francisco. And when you look at their pass-rush win rate with or without #97, it’s pretty drastic.

&amp;#x200B;

### 4. Josh Allen

The term “force of nature” I believe encapsulates best what type of player Allen is. He finished head and shoulders above the rest of the competition with his 52 big-time throws (compared to Mahomes’ 38), yet he also led the Bills in yards per rush (6.1), 1st downs (55) and touchdowns on the ground (7). Early on last season, it looked like he was unstoppable, because he started getting to his checkdowns and pick apart defenses trying to take away the deep ball, but once he injured the elbow on his throwing arm, the average depth of target actually increased substantially, because without precision accuracy, the payoff wasn’t worth the risk associated with high-volume underneath passing. With that being said, he will need to take better care of the ball in the red-zone. I believe we saw a healthy Allen become more efficient in those areas again, whilst still having the most lethal arm (strength) in football and killing defenses with his legs, as his 9.4 yards per scramble was second to only Justin Fields (9.6) among QBs with 10+ attempts.

&amp;#x200B;

### 5. Travis Kelce

Something Danny Heifetz of the Ringer’s Fantasy Football Show loves to bring up – the difference between having Kelce in half-PPR formats compared to the number two tight-end (T.J. Hockenson) was the same as the difference between that guy and TE22. He’s a cheat-code in all fantasy formats, but he’s even more frustrating to deal with for defenses in real life. No pass-catcher was responsible for more 1st downs (78) and touchdowns (12) last season than Kelce, with 90 total, finishing second in both categories. That’s despite seeing 32 and 28 fewer targets than the respective leaders among those marks. His ability to manipulate any man-defender with body-language and untraditional movements during the route or punish any voids left in zone coverage are immaculate. The implicit chemistry between him and Mahomes is hard to even verbalize, but it’s been a huge reason Kansas City has finished top-three in 3rd-down conversion rate each of the five years they’ve worked together.

&amp;#x200B;

### 6. Myles Garrett

With Nick Bosa missing almost all of 2020 and T.J. Watt being at full strength for half of this past season at best, you can easily make an argument that Garrett has been the best edge defender in football over the last three years. In 2022, he actually “fell” to second-team All-Pro after a couple of 1st-team nods, in large part because the Browns were in the bottom-quarter of the league in rushing yards average and total, which led to fewer favorable true pass-rush opportunities. However, he received the highest overall PFF grade (92.5) and pass-rush grade (93.5) among all defensive players in the NFL, along with being tied for fourth in TFLs (18). While I believe Garrett’s run defense is underappreciated, it’s how much more bendy he’s become and his ability to move across them line in passing situations that have made him a menace to block. That’s how he’s tied with T.J. Watt for the highest sack-per-game rate in NFL history (0.89).

&amp;#x200B;

### 7. Chris Jones

Since I just mentioned him, Myles Garrett was the only defensive player in the NFL with a higher overall PFF grade (92.3) than Jones, between week one and the Super Bowl. While I don’t believe he’ll ever be quite as dominant against the run as Aaron Donald has been, I thought he became a lot more impactful near the point of attack this past season and he was tied for seventh among all defensive players in TFLs (17). More importantly, looking at the PFF database, Jones’ 97 total pressures were 27(!) more than the next-closest interior defensive lineman, if you include the playoffs. The fact he put up the highest pass-rush win rate among interior D-linemen (20.2%) and 11 of his 15.5 sacks ended opposing drives is even more impressive considering he was double-teamed at the highest rate in the league (69%). He’s become a true closer for the league’s most dominant team.

&amp;#x200B;

### 8. Trent Williams

The only reason Trent isn’t considered an all-time great like Joe Thomas was (yet), entering the league three years later, is that he missed 29 games between 2016 and 2019 – which the last of those he sat out entirely. In three years with the 49ers, he has been the highest-graded offensive tackle in PFF’s database in each of those. That was the case in two other years in Washington (2013 and 2016). Williams has to be the scariest man to step in front of in the run game, where he can drive guys out to the sideline, cave in one side entirely for cutback lanes or make the knees of defenders shake when he gets out in space. Along with that, he has held opposing pass-rushers to just one sack each of the last two seasons and 61 total pressures across 1708 pass-blocking snaps these prior three years.

&amp;#x200B;

### 9. Aaron Donald

Even though Donald is coming off by far his least productive season as a pro, I could not ignore the resume of this all-time great and drop his outside the top-ten. Even if you just go by traditional statistics, his 103 sacks and 160 TFLs across 138 career games, that puts him into a league of his own as far interior D-linemen go. However, in four of the five seasons prior to 2022, he cracked at least 102 combined pressures, including the playoffs. Only Tamba Hali, J.J. Watt, Za’Darius Smith, Maxx Crosby and Micah Parsons have reached that number since PFF started tracking those back in 2006 – and they all only did it once each. However, that should not overshadow the type of disruption Donald creates in the run game, where his first step combined insane strength around 280 pounds constantly messes up plays. In fact, he has received an overall grade of over 90 in all nine of his seasons as a pro.

&amp;#x200B;

### 10. Joe Burrow

This guy is an absolute killer. I actually made a video on why the Bengals offense struggled during their 0-2 start to last season, but once they made the fundamental shift to a more 11-personnel heavy, spread approach, they became one of the most efficient offenses in the NFL (second behind only the Chiefs in EPA per play from week six onwards). Even with Ja’Marr Chase missing some time and the supposedly improved O-line having issues in protection for stretches, Joey B was able to finish behind only Mahomes with 279.7 passing yards per game and 35 TDs through the air, whilst being tied for the second-lowest time-to-throw (2.5 seconds). While the Bengals were probably one mental mistake in Kansas City away from going to back-to-back Super Bowl, after beating up the Bills at their place, Burrow himself was tied with Mahomes for the highest PFF grade (92.0), with the best big-time-throw (37) to turnover-worthy play (18) rate among the three (2.06-to-one).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/71fr7c2cdbhb1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e2cad374ac10fc637c297fdec63c84a08b2447

&amp;#x200B;

### 11. Micah Parsons

As Parsons has transitioned from off-ball backer all the way back to defensive end coming into 2023 – which Penn State originally recruited him as – he’s turned himself into one of the toughest guys to block in all of football. According to PFF, Micah led the NFL with 106 total pressures (across 577 pass-rush snaps) if you include the playoffs, and his 19.3% pressure rate was first as well. Not only has he made 1st-team All-Pro and finished second in DPOY voting each of his first two seasons, but he also joined Reggie White and Aldon Smith as the only three players with 13+ sacks in consecutive years to begin their careers. His speed off the edge is too much to handle for most NFL tackles, but he’s improved his ability to defeat their hands and the power he can convert that initial burst into shocks most opponents. He’s also uber-active in the run game, as somebody constantly fighting off contact and too fast to leave unblocked on the backside, while he forced three fumbles this past season.

&amp;#x200B;

### 12. Tyreek Hill

Until the last couple of weeks of the 2022 season, Hill was actually head-to-head with Justin Jefferson and if he didn’t lose QB1, he might’ve actually had those extra 100 yards he needed for the receiving crown (1710 yards). However, while those two actually shared almost the exact same target share around 40%, Tyreek was the only pass-catcher with 20+ targets to average at least three yards per route run (3.07 – about half a yard more than Jefferson). What’s crazy about that, is the fact that Miami actually didn’t set him up with a ton of run-after-catch opportunities, with hole-shots off wheel routes off motion and several deep balls chucked his way, where he actually needed to stop and work back towards the ball, making his 50% contested catch rate at 5’10” even more impressive. You watch the Ravens and Lions games – in which he put up 190 and 188 yards respectively – and this dude almost single-handedly earned them those wins, when everybody knew that’s where they were going in key spots.

&amp;#x200B;

### 13. Fred Warner

Fans of the linebacker position had the luxury of watching perennial All-Pros Luke Kuechly and Bobby Wagner during the 2010s, along with the tail-end of the Patrick Willis-NaVorro Bowman tandem. Well, since then a new alpha on the second level has separated himself from the rest of the pack in San Francisco. Fred Warner’s numbers across 86 career games are certainly impressive – 634 total tackles, four INTs, 35 PBUs, seven forced fumbles and 30 combined sacks and QB hits. However, it’s his impact on games that you can’t express in numbers that make him truly special – how he forces running backs to redirect because of how quickly he fills on the front-side, how he splits a couple of blockers to shut down screen passes, how he’s mugged up in the A-gap and is still able to carry the slot receiver 40 yards down the seams. His play speed is absolutely insane and just watching games, his presence is constantly felt. He’s also missed just 6.2% of his attempted tackles since 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

### 14. T.J. Watt

After a monster start in week one against the Bengals, when he had a sack, QB hit, three TFLs and an interception, Watt suffered a torn bicep at the end of the game and ended up missing a couple of months. He never quite returned to form, but we can’t forget what kind of insane path this guy has been on. Even with that injury-plagued 2022 campaign, Watt still has the most sacks (77.5), QB hits (162), and forced fumbles (23) since entering the league in 2017. He’s capable of taking over games in a hurry, but it’s his steady presence and effort to consistently affect the run and pass game that make him one of the game’s best. Looking at his impact when Watt was on the field this past season, the Steelers defense allowed 16.9 points per game and had 3.2 sacks per game (8-1 record). Without him, it allowed 25.3 points and had just 1.1 sacks (1-6 record).

&amp;#x200B;

### 15. Patrick Surtain II

As I’ve said before, if you’re looking at the job description of a cornerback, in terms of sticking to your man and not allowing him to catch passes, I believe Surtain has ascended to the top of the list. He earned the second-highest PFF grade in coverage (86.7) to only rookie sensation Sauce Gardner and while the raw numbers for opposing QBs targeting him (45-of-77 for 468 yards and four TDs vs. two INTs) don’t scream out lockdown corner to you, I believe context is needed. Unlike most teams today who either leave their guys on respective sides and/or play different variations of match-zone coverages, Pat II is legitimately isolated with the opposing team’s top outside receiver every week and the Broncos structure their defense around him. Watch his two matchups against Davante Adams last season, where he was all over the All-Pro receiver until the very last play of their overtime game, when because Josh McDaniels understood what kind of student of the game he was, they got him on a double-move off one of their staple concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

### 16. Zack Martin

I was shocked to find out Martin finished all the way down at 50th among all offensive linemen who played 100+ snaps last season in terms of PFF grade. Considering he didn’t allow a single sack, just two QB hits and 15 additional pressures on over 700 pass-blocking snaps, that had me scratching my head even more so. The reasoning behind it was a run-blocking grade of 63.7, which I just disagree with, considering he and his fellow linemen regularly placed defensive linemen in the laps of linebackers and guys never seem to disengage from him once he’s been able to latch his hands. Martin has now made 1st-team All-Pro six times and second-time twice, with the only year he didn’t reach either being 2020, when he played a career-low ten games (only one other time did he not reach at least 16 starts).

&amp;#x200B;

### 17. Ja’Marr Chase

After setting the NFL record for rookie receiving yards in 2021, Chase was still able to affect the 12 games he was available for in equal fashion. Seeing six more targets his way (134) and catching all of those (87), he was able to convert 50% of his targets and 77% of his receptions into either 1st downs or touchdowns. The amount of big plays (13 catches of 20+ yards) certainly decreased, but he was an even more reliable piece in key situations, as only Detroit’s Amon-Ra St. Brown converted more 3rd downs per game into 1st downs (1.42) among pass-catchers with 50+ targets. He can run by pretty much anybody and looks even faster with the ball in his hands, but he’s worked on his craft, in order to come open at the marker and find space along the sideline for crucial grabs. And acrossed 15 total games played (including playoffs), he finished below 50 yards just once. The one issue – he led the NFL with 0.92 drops per game (11 total).

&amp;#x200B;

### 18. Davante Adams

While Adams’ yards per game decreased to “only” 89.2 last season (still top-five), he led the NFL in receiving TDs for the second time in his career with 14. That’s despite being part of a Raiders offense that other than him and Josh Jacobs didn’t have any consistent producers among their skill-position group. If you put in perspective how much Davante meant for that unit, he not only accounted for half of their scoring through the air, but also second behind only D.J. Moore as part of a horrible Panthers offense, in the percentage share of his team’s air yardage (41.8%). However, while he was still a chain-mover for the Silver and Black, he was used downfield more than he ever in his career, as his 10.2 yards before the catch on average was just 0.1 yard behind Tyreek Hill and his 24 receptions of 20+ yards was just one behind the Miami speedster. That included a walk-off touchdown in overtime in their second Broncos game.

&amp;#x200B;

### 19. Lane Johnson

Really to express how freaking good Lane has been over these last few years, all I need to say is that he hasn’t allowed a sack since week 11 of 2020. He’s also only allowed one QB hit, despite spending over 1100 snaps in pass-pro since then and having faced some of the top-flight pass-rushers across the league. Johnson isn’t quite up to par with the brute force of his counterpart Jordan Mailata over at left tackle or as versatile in his usage as Jason Kelce at center, but he’s able to control and steer bodies in the run game, while his guy never seems to make the tackle. Johnson is the best pure pass-protector in the game today and got the job every week for the most devastating rushing attack in the NFL, as they led the league in total yards (3040) if you include the playoffs and set a new record with 42(!) TDs on the ground for a season.

&amp;#x200B;

### 20. Maxx Crosby

You need convincing that Crosby is one of the premiere defensive linemen in the game or just want to have fun for the next hour? Go put on some Raiders tape and watch this man go to work – please don’t pay attention to the rest of that defense though. Somehow because he’s this big white dude, people act like Crosby isn’t an above-90th percentile athlete for the position, yet he plays harder than anybody as physically gifted as he is. He’s not the most diverse pass-rusher, but his ability to put tackles of their heels and then throw in a spin move a couple of times per game gets the job done. According to PFF, his 189 total pressures over the last two years lead all defensive players, despite being on a below-average defenses and not having any playoff games to expand that number. Yet, he’s also hyper-active in the run game, to work off blocks and track down the ball-carrier, which is how he had three more tackles for loss (22) than any other player in the NFL, along with three forced fumbles.

&amp;#x200B;

### 21. Christian McCaffrey

After combining for just ten games the two years prior, McCaffrey was able to finally play a full 17 plus playoffs again in 2022. However, I believe to express how insane he is on a real offense – not the Panthers, who were literally dead-last in the NFL through the first six weeks, when the star running back was still there – we have to look at what he did as a member of the 49ers. Across 14 games and 263 touches for Kyle Shanahan, CMac racked up 1509 yards and 13 TDs from scrimmage, plus another passing TD. You could tell he ran with a different attitude once he got to San Francisco and him as another movable piece for that skill-position group almost seems unfair. Despite seeing the second-highest target share among running backs to only Austin Ekeler, Niner QBs had a passer rating of 115.5 when going McCaffrey’s way.

&amp;#x200B;

### 22. Chris Lindstrom

With the surprising fall of Quenton Nelson and the rest of the Colts offensive line, a new challenger to the Cowboys’ Zack Martin for the title of best guard in football emerged. Lindstrom received easily the highest PFF grade among offensive linemen (95.0), in particular without another interior guy quite cracking the 90-mark. His ability to create lateral displacement on the front-side of zone concepts, get to the outside edge of defenders in order to scoop them up away from the point of attack and take linebackers for a ride when he snatches them up was a huge factor in the Falcons finishing just two yards short of second in rushing yards (2718) and just outside the top-three in terms of yards per rush (4.9), despite having very inconsistent QB play to keep defenses from stacking the box. And while Lindstrom isn’t put in a ton of true dropbacks, with the league’s highest rate of RPOs (28.9% of pass attempts), only allowing nine total pressures across 517 pass-blocking snaps is highly impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

### 23. Minkah Fitzpatrick

This marks the second time in three years that Minkah finds himself atop my safety rankings on one of these lists and you almost can’t deny he’s become one of the games’ greats, earning his third 1st-team All-Pro nod in four years with the Steelers. Even with a couple of games missed due to injury, he was tied for a league-high six INTs, along with 11 more PBUs. However, he’s far from a finesse free safety. This guy can be an enforcer dropping as a robber or when you try to hit seam routes/benders against him in two-high shells. 2022 marked the second straight year with a run defense grade of over 82 for him and he missed a career-low 5.0% of his tackling attempts. Other than maybe Derwin James, he’s the most useful safety, but at the same time his knack for the ball also makes him the most dangerous one.

&amp;#x200B;

### 24. Sauce Gardner

Not enough is made of how rare it is for rookie cornerbacks to even be above-average starters, much less play at an All-Pro level. However, not only did Sauce win Defensive Rookie of the Year, but the Associated Press also named him 1st-team for how consistent he was all season, as he was tied for the best PFF coverage grade among all defensive backs (90.0). Along with his two interceptions, he led the league with 20 more passes broken up, despite only seeing 86 targets come his way. 46 of those got completed for 452 yards and one touchdown – which was actually on him based on their rules in zone coverage, but he was labelled the next-closest defender. With as zone-heavy as the Jets defensive system is, they ask their corners to help a lot in run support and Sauce didn’t back down at all as a tackler, missing just five of 80 attempts on the year.

&amp;#x200B;

### 25. Justin Herbert

Just looking at the total numbers, not only did Herbert set the all-time record for passing yards and touchdowns through year one and two, but he’s also sixth ever in TD-to-INT ratio (2.69). This past season despite losing his All-Pro left tackle mid-way through week three, Mike Williams and Keenan Allen missing 11 combined games, the team averaging just 3.8 yards per rush and Herbert fracturing his rib cartilage in week two already, he was able to throw 26 TDs compared to ten picks and lead the Chargers to ten wins. He finished tied for 31st in intended air yards per pass attempt due to the restrictions of the Joe Lombardi passing game, with so many static, repetitive concepts with no vertical stretching of defenses and very limited space created for run-after-catch opportunities. Putting statistical context to the tape, which shows how many bad plays he gets L.A. out of, he put up the fifth-lowest pressure-to-sack conversion rate (14.2%).

&amp;#x200B;

### 26. Nick Chubb

Chubb “only” finished third in total rushing yards last season (1525), but he also received 37 and 47 fewer carries than numbers one and two. He led the NFL with 47 rushes of 10+ yards and had the best missed tackle forced-per-carry rate at 27.5%. Yes, he operates behind one of the best offensive lines in football, but his ability to make those big guys look good with appropriate pacing, manipulation of 1st- or 2nd-level defenders and to get skinny for a nearly 230-pound back is tremendous. He squats about three times his weight, which shows up in the way he clears arm-tackles like turnstiles and is able to churn out yardage when he is actually wrapped up. The only reason he isn’t considered among the elite by everybody is his limited usage in the pass game, but he does average 6.3 yards per target for his career, despite a yards-before-catch average mark of -0.6. By the way, he just became the first running back ever to average at least five yards per carry for five straight years – which is as long as he’s been in the league.

&amp;#x200B;

### 27. Dexter Lawrence

I know nose-tackle isn’t the sexiest position for casual NFL fans, but we need to appreciate how dominant Sexy Dexy was in 2022. Only Myles Garrett received a higher PFF grade during the regular season (92.4) among all defensive players in the league and I would argue Lawrence was the most impactful player in New York’s first playoff win since 2011, as he abused the Vikings interior O-line throughout the day. Despite spending about two thirds of snaps between the guards, Lawrence finished second to only Chris Jones among interior defenders with 70 total pressures. Taking the playoffs into account, he was tied for sixth among all defensive linemen with 32 run stops, yet only missed just one of 69 tackling attempts. His ability to control guys on the inside one-on-one, swallow combos and take pass-blockers on the inside for a ride set up one of the most dominant seasons we’ve seen from a legit nose.

&amp;#x200B;

### 28. Quinnen Williams

While personnel-wise the Jets secondary experienced the biggest overhaul heading into this past year, their dramatic shift from dead-last to top-five across basically all defensive statistics can be equally connected to the ascent of Williams as a true difference-maker up front. While he had been an impactful starter his first three years with Gang Green, the former number three overall pick finally lived up to my lofty expectations for him coming out of Alabama. For the 2022 regular season, Big Q’s pressure-per-pass-rush-snap rate of 12.9% put him behind only Javon Hargrave and Chris Jones in terms of interior defensive linemen, while pro-football-reference has him tied for second with 28 QB hits. Despite only spending 270 snaps in run-defense (36th for his position) due to the heavy rotation New York uses, he was able to throw off plays before they could even get going with regularity and finished tied for sixth among that group with 12 TFLs.

&amp;#x200B;

### 29. Stefon Diggs

Even with Gabriel Davis being expected to break out in 2022 and QB Josh Allen banging up his elbow mid-way through the year, it didn’t really slow down Diggs’ production in in his eighth season, as he set personal highs in 1st downs (74) and TDs responsible for (11). Looking at his numbers among all wide receivers, he finished top-five in receiving yards (1429), 1st downs per receptions (46.8%) and passer rating when targeted (120.3). While he can still win down the field with tremendous focus and ball-skills (finished behind only Tyreek Hill and Davante Adams with six catches of 40+ yards), it’s his ability to win early in the route that have made him one of the most efficient high-volume targets across the league. With that being said, he was only tied for 18th in catches that converted 3rd downs (16), had a career-worst contested catch rate of just 46.2% (which is still pretty damn good) and he was tied for the tenth-most drops across the league (nine).

"Are the Pacers the most unlucky, competently-run organization in the NBA?",nba,"Reggie Miller's comments yesterday about the lack of a Ring got me thinking about the Pacers as a whole and made me realize that, unlike other teams whose inability to win was due to incompetent management (yeah yeah, Ik the irony of saying this as a Hornets fan), the Pacers actually did a good job over the decades, yet have been consistently unlucky as far as hitting generational brickwalls.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes. For example, in 2023 if Joel Embiid received 50 out of 100 first place MVP votes (i'm just making these numbers up), that would be 0.5 MVP shares. Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares.

The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.

Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially.

Is the idea of Scoot Henderson actually being a good G League player… true?,nba,"I posted this on r/nba_draft, and I would like to preface this by saying Scoot is a very talented player and was the 2nd best player in the draft.  Regardless of his efficiency, he is still a player who has potential to run an offense one day and be dynamic at the PG spot.


3 point shooting track record: 

Scoot is at: 
G League Reg Season career: 14/51 (27.5%) from 3


G League Showcase Career: 12/40 (30%) from 3 


and his free throw % is in the mid to low 70’s, it’s nothing great tbh


Since Scoot is a poor 3 point shooter and is only 6'2, he shoots around 58% at the rim overall iirc. However, most people don't acknowledge that Scoot doesn't actually get to the rim that much. He takes an extremely high volume of mid range shots which tank his effciency because even though he is good at them, they aren't inherently efficient shots when you have a bad 3 ball and only average FG at the rim

The G League has a rule where you shoot 1 free throw for 2 points, which heavily inflates his TS. If you were to assume that 1.8/2 free throws are only 2 point foul shots (meaning the other stuff is left out including techs, and 1s, etc.), his regular season TS this year would be 50%, which is likely the worst by far out of any G League guard that averages 16.5 (he averaged 16.5 points on 14.1 FGA)

If you want the proper efficiency metrics for his whole G League career;

&gt; So scoot had 441 pts on 142 twos 22 threes &amp; 54 FTs made. 142×2+22×3+54×1 = 404
441-404 = 37
""Normal"" rules he would have made 54+37 = 91 FTs

Personally, I've known that Scoot was inefficient but I don't think it matters too much because he is still a very talented player for his age. I do have some worries about his efficiency though given he needs to be a star, and I'm not sure an inefficient lead guard without an ELITE trait as a creator (Maybe his mid range game, but I don't think his rim pressure is as good as advertised) might keep him ffrom 1 on a championship team. I do think he is clearly the 2nd best player in the draft though, he's just super talented with a great feel for the game on offense. If I had more confidence in his defense, if he was an outlier in terms of getting to the rim or better at shooting, I feel like he would have a decent argument for being a better prospect 


[For reference, Scoot Henderson ranks 373rd/495in efficiency (TS%) among G League player players with 15 or more games played, go to page 6](https://stats.gleague.nba.com/players/advanced/?sort=TS_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=GP*GE*15&amp;Season=2022-23&amp;SeasonType=Combined)",t5_2qo4s,2768,482,"Is the idea of Scoot Henderson actually being a good G League player… true?I posted this on r/nba_draft, and I would like to preface this by saying Scoot is a very talented player and was the 2nd best player in the draft.  Regardless of his efficiency, he is still a player who has potential to run an offense one day and be dynamic at the PG spot.


3 point shooting track record: 

Scoot is at: 
G League Reg Season career: 14/51 (27.5%) from 3


G League Showcase Career: 12/40 (30%) from 3 


and his free throw % is in the mid to low 70’s, it’s nothing great tbh


Since Scoot is a poor 3 point shooter and is only 6'2, he shoots around 58% at the rim overall iirc. However, most people don't acknowledge that Scoot doesn't actually get to the rim that much. He takes an extremely high volume of mid range shots which tank his effciency because even though he is good at them, they aren't inherently efficient shots when you have a bad 3 ball and only average FG at the rim

The G League has a rule where you shoot 1 free throw for 2 points, which heavily inflates his TS. If you were to assume that 1.8/2 free throws are only 2 point foul shots (meaning the other stuff is left out including techs, and 1s, etc.), his regular season TS this year would be 50%, which is likely the worst by far out of any G League guard that averages 16.5 (he averaged 16.5 points on 14.1 FGA)

If you want the proper efficiency metrics for his whole G League career;

&gt; So scoot had 441 pts on 142 twos 22 threes &amp; 54 FTs made. 142×2+22×3+54×1 = 404
441-404 = 37
""Normal"" rules he would have made 54+37 = 91 FTs

Has an NBA game EVER officially ended in a tie?,nba,"In MLB and NHL history, there have been several games that ended in a tie due to some old school rules. Modern rules obviously do not allow such games. How about in the NBA? Has there ever been a game that officially ended in a tie? Could be something to do with OT rules not existing yet or multiple postponed out of nowhere in a late tied game or maybe single OT then calls it a tie?

Who wins a 7 game series: all time Centers vs all time Power Forwards?,nba,"Centers:

Starting lineup: Kareem, Hakeem, Shaq, Wilt, Bill Russell

Bench: David Robinson, Jokic, Moses Malone

Power Forwards: 

Starting lineup: Tim Duncan, Giannis, Dirk, KG, Karl Malone

Bench: Barkley, Mchale, Anthony Davis

Who would win?

The centers have more overall historical success and dominance but in a pure basketball lineup they are heavily lacking in spacing aside from Jokic and David Robinson, and Hakeem a bit but would be ridiculously dominant in the paint. Defensively they have ridiculous rim protection and paint defense but not great ability to defend out in the perimeter aside from Hakeem and bill Russell. Overall they don’t have much elite playmaking but of course they do have Jokic who’s one of the best playmakers of all time. All of them are dominant rebounders. Aside from Jokic don’t really have anyone who’s comfortable dribbling the ball for an extended period of time. 

Power forwards have a lot more versatility on offense and defense. They have guys who space the floor with 3s and midrange shots in dirk, KG, Tim Duncan, AD, Karl malone. Basically all of them are dominant paint scorers, particularly Barkley, Mchale, malone, Giannis. On defense they have have a lot of dominant rim protectors in Tim Duncan, KG, Giannis, AD.

&gt; On Friday and again Saturday against the U.S. Select Team, Jalen Brunson, Brandon Ingram, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Mikal Bridges started for the national team, which will compete at the FIBA World Cup this month.

&gt;**In Friday’s loss to the Select Team, Cam Johnson was the fifth starter. But in Team USA’s commanding 84-61 win over the Select Team in three, 10-minute periods, Anthony Edwards opened with the starting unit.** The next time the Americans play will be their first exhibition game, at 10:30 p.m. Monday against Puerto Rico, and if consistency in scrimmages means anything the starters will probably come out of those six.

&gt; **“I have nothing set in stone,” Kerr insisted after the Saturday scrimmage.”We’re learning as we go. I thought we learned a lot from yesterday and we’ll learn a lot from today.** It’s great to have these things on tape so we can go back and look at stuff.

&gt;“There will be a lot of really interesting possible combinations just because of the skill these guys have.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Kerr was raving about the passing ability the Americans showed through two scrimmages, and there were a number of context clues from commentary on how Team USA’s collective ball movement has allowed the team to bond quickly. “I think passing does that in general,” Kerr said. “When you have good passers, teams connect quickly. … Brandon Ingram made about four drive-and-kicks yesterday that were incredible plays, leading to wide-open shots. Anthony Edwards has really been moving the ball. And some of these guys have it come so naturally to them, Tyrese (Haliburton), Austin Reaves – these guys are great passers. Jalen from the point guard spot. Mikal as well, and you start adding in the bigs. They’re all of a sudden out of a short roll. We’re getting swings to the perimeter. The whole group is connected and it’s really fun to watch.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Edwards said he’s “ready to play, whatever they ask me to do. “Score the ball, create open shots for others,” Edwards said, when describing what Team USA has asked him to do. “I can get by my man pretty, pretty easily so get by my man, make the team help and you create shots. I also have to defend, rebound, and just, you know, be a voice.”

A team without a top 30 player but double the salary cap,nba,"Looking at past NBA champions where almost every team has at least one top guy in the league has always got me wondering how much depth would you need to edge out the front-loaded top contenders. 

Debates on top-30 aside, I think a core of say Jrue Holiday, Darius Garland, Mikal Bridges, and Jaren Jackson could already be very good. Pay each of these guys 30-40 million and at 120-160 total you would still have almost an entire second salary cap to fill out the rest of the roster with, allowing you to easily go 8-12 deep with pretty elite players. 

Assuming you can get most players within reason (not just combining every overly-valuable contract in the league, but actually paying guys what they are worth), how much depth would it take to overwhelm a team like the Nuggets who have to eventually give minutes to players like Braun and Cancar (no disrespect to them)? Could you build a contending team with no players in the top 40 or 50? Or do you think the top superstars would still outshine depth no matter what?

The All-Star Game Can Be Legendary,nba,"Ever since last year when Luka was mic'd up for the first few possessions and just let defenders go right by him for 3 minutes while he did an in-game interview while playing, I have been on a mission to create a truly competitive ASG environment.   It's just such a shame to waste all that talent on the court at the same time.

 I went back and watched all the ASG highlights for the past 25 seasons.  I tried to find any time people were competitive and why they were competitive.  I looked for any type of format that may have worked better than the other.  I wanted to piece together and unlock the ultimate ASG format that creates Legends, not jokes.

And so I reveal, today, the best possible ASG format to create competitiveness IMHO.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Very important 1st rule: If you play in the ASG, then you are eligible for all End of Season Awards at 64 games played instead of 65
2. There is no more drafting or Captains, this actually removes competitiveness as it creates comfortability and familiarity for the top players.  **We want to leverage a sense of unease and chips on shoulders that comes from haphazard fan voting.**
3. The 5 players who get the most votes is Team 1. 
4. The next 5 players who got the next most votes is Team 2.  So on until 4 Teams is created.
5. *The 5th team is entirely created by the coaches.*
6. After the teams are created, the NBA has an Ad campaign featuring Team 1 as the greatest 5 man team in the world and who could possibly beat them?  Use the commercial to show some of the other players from other teams and ask ""Could the coaches team win it all this year?"" at the end.
7. Sunday Night ASG.  Team 1 takes the court vs Team 2.  There is no clock aside from shot clock.
8. All shots are 1 point.  Threes are worth 2 points.  
9. *First team to score 10 points stays on the court and plays the next Team.*  
10. Teams rotate in order while the winners always stay on the floor.
11. First team to total 50 points wins the ASG. 
12. The best player of the winning team gets the Kobe Bryant Trophy
13. The other players from the winning team get the Black Mamba Legends - Medallions that go around their neck, placed on each teammate by the MVP. 

Some notes about why this would raise competition

* This will be the first time in ASG history that the top 5 vote getters would play together, and all the other teams will want to take them down.  Having that kind of power in 1 starting lineup is extremely marketable as well. 
* Winners Stay rules.  Quite simple, you want to get ASG MVP? **You want to get play time? You have to win.  You aren't just given your minutes freely by the coach.** 
* The Teams 2/3/4 will have chips on shoulders.  The Coaches team will be extra motivated to prove themselves and force other teams to play hard or they will run the table. 
* The 5 on 5 setting and winners stays rule is extremely intimate, which breeds competitiveness. 
* Tons of media heads will eat up comparing these teams before they play. Speculation and clicks will be high creating more pressure for the players to perform well

&amp;#x200B;",t5_2qo4s,3346,600,"The All-Star Game Can Be LegendaryEver since last year when Luka was mic'd up for the first few possessions and just let defenders go right by him for 3 minutes while he did an in-game interview while playing, I have been on a mission to create a truly competitive ASG environment.   It's just such a shame to waste all that talent on the court at the same time.

 I went back and watched all the ASG highlights for the past 25 seasons.  I tried to find any time people were competitive and why they were competitive.  I looked for any type of format that may have worked better than the other.  I wanted to piece together and unlock the ultimate ASG format that creates Legends, not jokes.

And so I reveal, today, the best possible ASG format to create competitiveness IMHO.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Very important 1st rule: If you play in the ASG, then you are eligible for all End of Season Awards at 64 games played instead of 65
2. There is no more drafting or Captains, this actually removes competitiveness as it creates comfortability and familiarity for the top players.  **We want to leverage a sense of unease and chips on shoulders that comes from haphazard fan voting.**
3. The 5 players who get the most votes is Team 1. 
4. The next 5 players who got the next most votes is Team 2.  So on until 4 Teams is created.
5. *The 5th team is entirely created by the coaches.*
6. After the teams are created, the NBA has an Ad campaign featuring Team 1 as the greatest 5 man team in the world and who could possibly beat them?  Use the commercial to show some of the other players from other teams and ask ""Could the coaches team win it all this year?"" at the end.
7. Sunday Night ASG.  Team 1 takes the court vs Team 2.  There is no clock aside from shot clock.
8. All shots are 1 point.  Threes are worth 2 points.  
9. *First team to score 10 points stays on the court and plays the next Team.*  
10. Teams rotate in order while the winners always stay on the floor.
11. First team to total 50 points wins the ASG.

**50%:** Jordan Poole will average 27+ PPG next season and not make the all star team similiar to Bradley Beal in 2020

**60%:** People are underrating how good the Rockets off season was. Everyone is calling the FA signings woeful but its simply not true. The FVV one is especially underrated and I expect the Rockets to have an 11 seed floor and a 6 seed ceiling. Around 35-45 wins

**70%:** Players who are not very efficient and their main attribute is their scoring who also play mid defense are the most overrated players and cannot play winning basketball (Carmelo Anthony)

**80%:** Russell Westbrook is not a winning basketball player and his stats were empty in his MVP season. I think he only won because of the narrative of a TD season. (Love Russ tho)

Josh Giddey is awesome. He needs to change.,nba," The Thunder are weird.

Their ostensible point guard and alpha dog, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, scored more than 30 points per game by dancing through and around defenders. A flamenco for a finger-roll, a salsa for a slam. He’s also the rare true-blue star guard who doesn’t really shoot from deep, which imposes unusual roster-building rules upon Oklahoma City.

Ideally, a team’s secondary stars and role players should accentuate the main character. Rising sophomore Jalen Williams, likely OKC’s second-best player already, seems to be an easy fit next to anyone. Chet Holmgren hasn’t played an NBA minute yet, but the mouthwatering *idea* of him is as a shot-obliterating, flamethrowing stretch-five, both mitigating SGA’s weaknesses and enhancing his strengths. Lu Dort needs to hit more shots, but he certainly puts up enough threes (and his defense is killer).

That leaves Josh Giddey, the 6’8” 20-year-old from Australia. Giddey, as currently constructed, doesn’t quite make sense next to SGA. Defense and shooting are arguably the most critical attributes for non-superstars, and unfortunately, Giddey is the opposite of a 3-and-D player right now.

Despite what the narrative suggests, however, Giddey’s outside shot isn’t his only concern — when he gets close to the hoop, the bugbear bites. He hit 62% of his attempts at the rim last season, a respectable number for a typical 6’4” shooting guard but a mediocre mark for a 6’8” ox masquerading as a wing. He has no problem using his size to get to the paint but seems to shy away from contact at the last minute despite acceptable free throw percentages.

Giddey averaged a paltry 1.9 free throw attempts per game, a jarring number for someone [who shot 40% of their attempts at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/21/player#tab-shooting_frequency). With SGA averaging more than ten free throw attempts per game, there might not be a lot of freebies left over, but Giddey has to be more assertive in the paint.

Although he has a solid handle, a lack of first-step burst hampers Giddey. He often creates advantages at the top of the key or on the wing that he loses by the time he gets to the rim.

Another problem: shot selection. Giddey has a good floater game when he gets to the short midrange. That’s a weapon when used judiciously, but like oversalted pot roast, Giddey sprinkles it in a little too often. Giddey’s lack of athleticism and irrational fear of contested layups results in forced teardrops, dragging down his efficiency numbers.

But Giddey’s passing is sublime. He’s easily the best table-setter on the Thunder, and he’d be a league leader in assists if he were the primary ballhandler. Despite sharing the court with SGA, he assisted on 30% of his teammates’ made shots last season, a number on par with LeBron and Giannis. He can throw the ball with either hand and utilizes an unusual variety of velocities to trick defenders and set up teammates.

It’s easy to imagine that assist number rising if Holmgren, Williams, and other teammates can help space the floor more effectively; OKC was a below-average three-point shooting team in both frequency and accuracy, which was particularly true of the starting lineup. Better shooting means more room for Giddey’s beloved bounce passes.

Giddey’s wizardry with the ball is at its best on inbounds plays. His height gives him access to more angles than most inbounders, and his daring opens up passing lanes nobody else would try. The Thunder love to run a play springing Shai free for a cut from the top of the arc to the hoop as Giddey mischievously throws it right behind an unaware defender's butt (see link in comments for an example).

Giddey is also an exceptional rebounder on both ends for his size — he has a better offensive rebounding rate than Joel Embiid and a better defensive rebounding rate than Mitchell Robinson. The defensive rebounds, in particular, are key, as they let him grab the ball and immediately push up the floor, where he’s a beast in transition.

Giddey’s defense will always be somewhat problematic. He’s 6’8” with T-rex arms, and the lack of horizontal and vertical burst limits his effectiveness both in space and at the rim. There are times when he'll contest a dunk, but he can barely even get off the ground before the ball is rattling through the hoop.

 At least Giddey doesn’t make many “business decisions” to get out of the way. He does try hard on defense, which matters, and he’s generally in the right spots at the right time. He rarely fouls, and like most great passers, Giddey can use his vision to anticipate the other team’s ball movement to get steals and deflections. He doesn’t so much jump passing lanes as lurk in them, crocodilian eyes peering out while he waits, submerged, for a foolish mistake (link in comments).

When watching Thunder games, it feels like he’s involved in more defensive plays than the numbers show. Giddey will never be a great defender, but just being big and smart is enough to ensure a baseline level of not-terribleness. He should become acceptably mediocre.

Acceptably mediocre would be a boon to his outside shot. A lot hinges on him further developing his three-point jumper. Before last season, the Thunder hired legendary shooting coach Chip Engelland away from the Spurs (and gave him a nice promotion to assistant coach). Giddey reaped the benefits. Last year’s 32.5% (on 3.1 attempts per game) doesn’t sound great on paper, but it’s a noteworthy step up from his rookie year’s 26.3% mark.

For what it’s worth, Giddey shoots it confidently, and his improvement was encouraging. Giddey doesn’t need to be a knockdown shooter, but like his defense, getting to average-ish would greatly benefit others and himself. Nearly all of Giddey’s threes were assisted; if he could become more comfortable creating one for himself, it would mitigate his lack of an initial first step and open up more driving lanes. It would also go a long way toward improving his partnership with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

I’ve been sitting here side-eyeing the pachyderm in the room while describing Giddey’s game, but the elephant is getting restless. Here’s the fundamental question that will change the direction of the Oklahoma City Thunder for the next half-decade: can Giddey and SGA play together?

This isn’t new; [I talked about it ](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/weekly-hodgepodge-deep-fakes-are)at the beginning of last year, when the answer sure looked like a resounding “no.” As of Nov 10, 2022:

* Shai w/o Giddey: +17 points per 100 possessions; 97th percentile
* Giddey w/o Shai: -12 points per 100 possessions, 7th percentile
* Both together: -16 points per 100 possessions, -infinity percentile

It was brutal! But things smoothed out as the season went on. Full-season numbers (from Cleaning the Glass) paint a slightly different picture:

* Shai w/o Giddey: +7.3 points per 100 possessions
* Giddey w/o Shai: -4.4 points per 100 possessions.
* Both together: -1.3 points per 100 possessions.

Giddey’s passing is an essential part of OKC’s offense, but it’s hard to ignore how much better the team was with him off the floor — Giddey had [the worst on/off point differential](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/21/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) of any big-minute Thunder player.

Shai got better at cutting off Giddey’s playmaking, and the team got more thoughtful about putting Giddey in spots that wouldn’t cramp SGA’s jagged drives. And the team heavily staggered Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander to ensure each got time to drive the bus.

But SGA is the engine, chassis, drivetrain, and bespoke paint job of the Thunder’s offense. For four straight years, the team has been unable to score whenever SGA is off the court, and Giddey’s passing talents haven’t been able to change that.

Improvement from the Thunder’s surrounding cast will make a big difference, particularly if Holmgren and young forward Jalen Williams can make an impact with three-point shooting.

But a -1.3 net rating isn’t good. When Giddey’s defender ignores him, Giddey needs to do *something.* A cut, a relocation along the perimeter, an off-ball screen (Draymond Green can be the inspiration here), anything to punish the defense’s temerity. 

Giddey improved at this as the season went along, and grew particularly adept at timing his cuts from the corner to the basket as Shai wove into the lane. But there's still room for growth.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the Thunder’s Moses. If they are to escape the desert, he must be the guide. It falls to everyone else to adjust their games to his idiosyncratic style. To become a part of the Thunder’s future, Giddey needs to change. He must stop settling for floaters, finish stronger, defend better, and become an outside threat.

That sounds like a lot, but let’s not forget: despite having two full seasons under his belt, Giddey can’t even order a [Great Northern](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/drink/australias-top-selling-beers-for-2022-revealed/news-story/96e0a16f27a39c0d821cb1a62f419590) for another two months. He showed substantial improvement across the board from his rookie to his sophomore season, and there are plenty of reasons to think he'll continue along the upward track. He shot 48% from the field overall in his second year, a massive improvement from the 42% he hit as a rookie.

Most of the things he struggles with can be developed. The Thunder can afford to be patient for another year to see his progress.

I am high on both Giddey and the potential of the Thunder’s core. I believe that Giddey’s exemplary passing is something every team needs, and although it hasn’t shown in the numbers yet, it should have a cascading positive effect on the offense.

But SGA is in his prime right now, and OKC has a bevy of assets for any team shopping the next disgruntled star. For all his talent, Giddey will never be the lab-grown perfect running mate next to Gilgeous-Alexander. If they can’t develop better chemistry sooner rather than later, Giddey might be packing up his hair products and moving elsewhere in 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;",t5_2qo4s,10136,1611,"Josh Giddey is awesome. He needs to change. The Thunder are weird.

Their ostensible point guard and alpha dog, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, scored more than 30 points per game by dancing through and around defenders. A flamenco for a finger-roll, a salsa for a slam. He’s also the rare true-blue star guard who doesn’t really shoot from deep, which imposes unusual roster-building rules upon Oklahoma City.

Ideally, a team’s secondary stars and role players should accentuate the main character. Rising sophomore Jalen Williams, likely OKC’s second-best player already, seems to be an easy fit next to anyone. Chet Holmgren hasn’t played an NBA minute yet, but the mouthwatering *idea* of him is as a shot-obliterating, flamethrowing stretch-five, both mitigating SGA’s weaknesses and enhancing his strengths. Lu Dort needs to hit more shots, but he certainly puts up enough threes (and his defense is killer).

That leaves Josh Giddey, the 6’8” 20-year-old from Australia. Giddey, as currently constructed, doesn’t quite make sense next to SGA. Defense and shooting are arguably the most critical attributes for non-superstars, and unfortunately, Giddey is the opposite of a 3-and-D player right now.

Despite what the narrative suggests, however, Giddey’s outside shot isn’t his only concern — when he gets close to the hoop, the bugbear bites. He hit 62% of his attempts at the rim last season, a respectable number for a typical 6’4” shooting guard but a mediocre mark for a 6’8” ox masquerading as a wing. He has no problem using his size to get to the paint but seems to shy away from contact at the last minute despite acceptable free throw percentages.

Giddey averaged a paltry 1.9 free throw attempts per game, a jarring number for someone [who shot 40% of their attempts at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/21/player#tab-shooting_frequency). With SGA averaging more than ten free throw attempts per game, there might not be a lot of freebies left over, but Giddey has to be more assertive in the paint.

Although he has a solid handle, a lack of first-step burst hampers Giddey. He often creates advantages at the top of the key or on the wing that he loses by the time he gets to the rim.

Another problem: shot selection. Giddey has a good floater game when he gets to the short midrange. That’s a weapon when used judiciously, but like oversalted pot roast, Giddey sprinkles it in a little too often. Giddey’s lack of athleticism and irrational fear of contested layups results in forced teardrops, dragging down his efficiency numbers.

But Giddey’s passing is sublime. He’s easily the best table-setter on the Thunder, and he’d be a league leader in assists if he were the primary ballhandler. Despite sharing the court with SGA, he assisted on 30% of his teammates’ made shots last season, a number on par with LeBron and Giannis. He can throw the ball with either hand and utilizes an unusual variety of velocities to trick defenders and set up teammates.

It’s easy to imagine that assist number rising if Holmgren, Williams, and other teammates can help space the floor more effectively; OKC was a below-average three-point shooting team in both frequency and accuracy, which was particularly true of the starting lineup. Better shooting means more room for Giddey’s beloved bounce passes.

Giddey’s wizardry with the ball is at its best on inbounds plays. His height gives him access to more angles than most inbounders, and his daring opens up passing lanes nobody else would try. The Thunder love to run a play springing Shai free for a cut from the top of the arc to the hoop as Giddey mischievously throws it right behind an unaware defender's butt (see link in comments for an example).

Giddey is also an exceptional rebounder on both ends for his size — he has a better offensive rebounding rate than Joel Embiid and a better defensive rebounding rate than Mitchell Robinson. The defensive rebounds, in particular, are key, as they let him grab the ball and immediately push up the floor, where he’s a beast in transition.

Giddey’s defense will always be somewhat problematic. He’s 6’8” with T-rex arms, and the lack of horizontal and vertical burst limits his effectiveness both in space and at the rim. There are times when he'll contest a dunk, but he can barely even get off the ground before the ball is rattling through the hoop.

 At least Giddey doesn’t make many “business decisions” to get out of the way. He does try hard on defense, which matters, and he’s generally in the right spots at the right time. He rarely fouls, and like most great passers, Giddey can use his vision to anticipate the other team’s ball movement to get steals and deflections. He doesn’t so much jump passing lanes as lurk in them, crocodilian eyes peering out while he waits, submerged, for a foolish mistake (link in comments).

When watching Thunder games, it feels like he’s involved in more defensive plays than the numbers show. Giddey will never be a great defender, but just being big and smart is enough to ensure a baseline level of not-terribleness. He should become acceptably mediocre.

Acceptably mediocre would be a boon to his outside shot. A lot hinges on him further developing his three-point jumper. Before last season, the Thunder hired legendary shooting coach Chip Engelland away from the Spurs (and gave him a nice promotion to assistant coach). Giddey reaped the benefits. Last year’s 32.5% (on 3.1 attempts per game) doesn’t sound great on paper, but it’s a noteworthy step up from his rookie year’s 26.3% mark.

For what it’s worth, Giddey shoots it confidently, and his improvement was encouraging. Giddey doesn’t need to be a knockdown shooter, but like his defense, getting to average-ish would greatly benefit others and himself. Nearly all of Giddey’s threes were assisted; if he could become more comfortable creating one for himself, it would mitigate his lack of an initial first step and open up more driving lanes. It would also go a long way toward improving his partnership with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

I’ve been sitting here side-eyeing the pachyderm in the room while describing Giddey’s game, but the elephant is getting restless. Here’s the fundamental question that will change the direction of the Oklahoma City Thunder for the next half-decade: can Giddey and SGA play together?

This isn’t new; [I talked about it ](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/weekly-hodgepodge-deep-fakes-are)at the beginning of last year, when the answer sure looked like a resounding “no.” As of Nov 10, 2022:

* Shai w/o Giddey: +17 points per 100 possessions; 97th percentile
* Giddey w/o Shai: -12 points per 100 possessions, 7th percentile
* Both together: -16 points per 100 possessions, -infinity percentile

It was brutal! But things smoothed out as the season went on. Full-season numbers (from Cleaning the Glass) paint a slightly different picture:

* Shai w/o Giddey: +7.3 points per 100 possessions
* Giddey w/o Shai: -4.4 points per 100 possessions.
* Both together: -1.3 points per 100 possessions.

Giddey’s passing is an essential part of OKC’s offense, but it’s hard to ignore how much better the team was with him off the floor — Giddey had [the worst on/off point differential](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/21/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) of any big-minute Thunder player.

How would you build Team USA this year if you had to abide by the salary cap?,nba,"This was just a thought I had the other night, as I was hearing people talk about how ""bad"" the roster is for Team USA in the World Cup, but everyone on the roster is still basically a top-3 player on their own team. So, if you had to build an actual team with the NBA salary cap rules, with like actual ""backup"" level players on the team, what would it look like?

Here are the rules: Use salaries for the upcoming 2024 season. The salary cap for this year is going to be $136.021 million. The first apron level is $172.346 million, the second apron level is $182.794 million. If you go past the $136.021 million mark, you can go up to the second apron, but you have to use players that were signed using ""exceptions"" this year (midlevel, biannual, minimum, etc.) beyond that. You cannot go past the second apron.

Any G-League, college, or American players in international leagues will count as the minimum salary, which we're just going to round to $1 million. (If it helps, to stay under the salary cap, you'd need each player to average $11.3 million. To stay under the second apron, it'd need to average $15.2 million.)

For reference, here's what the current team makes:

* Paolo Banchero, Forward, Orlando Magic, $11.6 million
* Mikal Bridges, Forward, Brooklyn Nets, $21.7 million
* Jalen Brunson, Guard, New York Knicks, $26.3 million
* Anthony Edwards, Guard, Minnesota Timberwolves, $13.5 million
* Tyrese Haliburton, Guard, Indiana Pacers, $5.8 million
* Josh Hart, Guard, New York Knicks, $12.9 million
* Brandon Ingram, Forward, New Orleans Pelicans, $33.8 million
* Jaren Jackson Jr., Center, Memphis Grizzlies, $27.1 million
* Cam Johnson, Forward, Brooklyn Nets, $25.6 million
* Walker Kessler, Center, Utah Jazz, $2.8 million
* Bobby Portis, Forward, Milwaukee Bucks, $11.7 million
* Austin Reaves, Guard, Los Angeles Lakers, $12.0 million

Team total: $204.8 million (so some cuts/replacements would need to be made.)

A quick glance at the other [rosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup_squads) in the tournament looks like everyone else would definitely be under at least the second apron.

What Are Some of the Worst *Non-2016* Free Agency Signings in NBA History?,nba,"At this point, it's pretty well known and often discussed how bad much of the signings were for the 2016 offseason.  Part of that can be blamed on the massive spike in cap space but regardless, we saw a lot of awful signings that year.  Joakin Noah, Luol Deng, Nic Batum, Timofey Mozgov and Bismack Biyombo are but a few of the players we saw sign contracts for lifechanging money, even if the contracts themselves aged like milk left out in the sun.

But we're not here to talk about those signings.  We're here to talk about some of the all-time worst free agency signings outside of that infamous year.  Which ones come to mind?  

Off the top of my head, here are some of the more infamous options out there:

**Eddy Curry - $60M, 6 year contract (2005)**

Eddy Curry was sort of the precursor to Andrea Bargnani, in that he was a 7 foot center who couldn't rebound and wasn't a good defender; Curry's rebounding career high was a whopping 7 per game.  He wasn't a good shooter, his later years were marred by injury and general health issues - in his final 2 seasons with the Knicks he played **a total of 10 games** \- and yet, the start of his Knicks tenure was punctuated by a fairly substantial contract for 2005, the reasons for which that are still being studied to this day.  10M AAV back in the day when contracts could go as long as 6 years?  This is a classic ""Dolan is interfering with decision-making"" bad contract and it probably won't be the last one to pop up on this list.

Did I mention this also doubles as a classic bad Knicks trade?  Because the Knicks actually gave up assets to get Eddy via a sign and trade.

**Davis Bertans - $80M, 5 year contract (2021)**

You know what the Wizards are really good at?  Making the most out of bad contracts.  They were able to flip Davis Bertans and Spencer Dinwiddie into Kristaps Porzingus, a borderline All-Star that would net them Tyus Jones in a future trade when Tingus Pingus could have left them for nothing.  Not too shabby.  They even got a pick out of the affair!

You know who gave Davis Bertans that awful contract?  The Washington Wizards.  Probably the most recent example of a classic bad contract, Bertans was a shooter who, prior to his signing was shooting an efficient 52/41/85 on around 5 3s a game.  Sure he wasn't the best defender but he was a reliable threat from outside that helped space the floor and take some of the offensive load off Beal...

...then the 2021/22 season happened and he seemingly forgot how to shoot.  A drastic decrease in shooting to sub-36% from beyond the arc and and equally shocking drop in field goal percentage to less than 39%, the fact that Washington was able to get anything from Bertans is astonishing in its own right.  He was later dumped on the Thunder so they could move up to acquire Cason Wallace and while it's been a long time coming, this is a bad contract that will soon be off the books as his 2024/25 season has an early termination option that whomever team's he's ending up on will almost certainly take.  

$5 million is substantially less than $16 million, after all.

 **Juwan Howard - $115M, 7 year contract (1996)**

You're not going to see too many older contracts on this list and probaly even fewer in the comments section.  That's for a couple of reasons, most of which pertain to the politics of the league in its earlier days, the wacky length rookie players could be signed to before becoming unrestricted free agents rather than the 4 + QO/""whenever their extension ends or they force their way to another team"" of today, and the deck being heavily stacked in favor of ownership retaining players due to the rules at the time being best described as ""endless restricted free agency"".  A lot of that changed in the 90s and while leaving teams had a lot of stigma against it, players like Shaq jumped teams to get paid what they were worth after the team that drafted them lowballed them in free agency.

Juwan Howard...did not change teams...sort of, we'll get to the mess that happened with the signing itself, and technically his team's name did change as the Washington Bullets were renamed the Wizards later on, but in 1996 he was an unrestricted free agent and, coming off of an All-Star season where he got a 3rd Team nod, Howard was looking to get paid.  And paid he was!  

At around 16.4M AAV and locked in for 7 years, Howard peaked in his sophomore season but he wasn't bad necessarily.  He just...never became more than what he could have, and he wasn't pulling a bad team consistently into the playoffs; their peak was getting swept by the 1997 Bulls as the 8th seed.  He was your classic ""good stats, bad team"" player and though he never accomplished much as a Wizard, he can at least call himself an NBA champion as he rode the bench to a repeat via the Heatles.  The man had an absurdly long career even if he himself wasn't particularly successful but with 2 rings and a historic career earning (we'll get into that in a minute), I doubt he very much cares what you or I think of him.

The main reason why he's worth mentioning is that he was technically the first player to sign the largest contract in NBA history up to that point; the first contract in NBA history to go over $100 million, it was a contract that the Bullets/Wizards could have decided to not get into a bidding war with the Heat who offered him a more lucrative contract, albeit one that stirred some controversy at the time and that the league itself nullified due to cap rules at the time and some mishaps regarding bonuses to Tim Hardaway and P.J. Brown.  Also Alonzo Mourning had an extension at around the same time which is a part of this debacle.  The whole saga is a lot more interesting than the contract itself and it's worth a Google if you're curious about it; I didn't even touch on how Washington eventually re-signed Howard and all the implications said signing had at the time.  

This went to court.  No really, lawyers got involved.

Over who could sign Juwan Howard.

It was weird.

**Amar’e Stoudemire - $100M, 5 year contract (2010)**

Another classic bad Knicks contract though this one isn't entirely fair to New York because Stoudemire was excellent in his first year in the Garden.  25/8/2, Amar'e was still his All-Star self and even helped the team make the playoffs for the first time since 2004!  

The rest of that contract's duration?  Injuries in the later years, the loss of the late acquisition of Chauncey Billups from the prior season and an iso-heavy offense running through Melo did not do Stoudemire any favors, and did I mention the injuries?  This honestly wouldn't have been such a bad signing were it not for them but it's not like the Knicks were unaware that Amar'e could be a risky signing due to injury given some of the wear and tear from his days in Phoenix; he already had two  major surgeries on different parts of his body up to that point and his knees had the fortitude of a wet chip.

Amar'e is one of the most influential 4s of the modern era and he was integral to the revolutionary 7SoL Suns but his stint with the Knicks started out hot and cooled off very quickly.  Yet another unfortunate case where injuries robbed a truly special talent of what could have been an even more impactful and lengthy career.",t5_2qo4s,7303,1337,"What Are Some of the Worst *Non-2016* Free Agency Signings in NBA History?At this point, it's pretty well known and often discussed how bad much of the signings were for the 2016 offseason.

A drastic decrease in shooting to sub-36% from beyond the arc and and equally shocking drop in field goal percentage to less than 39%, the fact that Washington was able to get anything from Bertans is astonishing in its own right.  He was later dumped on the Thunder so they could move up to acquire Cason Wallace and while it's been a long time coming, this is a bad contract that will soon be off the books as his 2024/25 season has an early termination option that whomever team's he's ending up on will almost certainly take.  

$5 million is substantially less than $16 million, after all.

 **Juwan Howard - $115M, 7 year contract (1996)**

You're not going to see too many older contracts on this list and probaly even fewer in the comments section.  That's for a couple of reasons, most of which pertain to the politics of the league in its earlier days, the wacky length rookie players could be signed to before becoming unrestricted free agents rather than the 4 + QO/""whenever their extension ends or they force their way to another team"" of today, and the deck being heavily stacked in favor of ownership retaining players due to the rules at the time being best described as ""endless restricted free agency"".  A lot of that changed in the 90s and while leaving teams had a lot of stigma against it, players like Shaq jumped teams to get paid what they were worth after the team that drafted them lowballed them in free agency.

Juwan Howard...did not change teams...sort of, we'll get to the mess that happened with the signing itself, and technically his team's name did change as the Washington Bullets were renamed the Wizards later on, but in 1996 he was an unrestricted free agent and, coming off of an All-Star season where he got a 3rd Team nod, Howard was looking to get paid.  And paid he was!  

At around 16.4M AAV and locked in for 7 years, Howard peaked in his sophomore season but he wasn't bad necessarily.  He just...never became more than what he could have, and he wasn't pulling a bad team consistently into the playoffs; their peak was getting swept by the 1997 Bulls as the 8th seed.  He was your classic ""good stats, bad team"" player and though he never accomplished much as a Wizard, he can at least call himself an NBA champion as he rode the bench to a repeat via the Heatles.  The man had an absurdly long career even if he himself wasn't particularly successful but with 2 rings and a historic career earning (we'll get into that in a minute), I doubt he very much cares what you or I think of him.

The main reason why he's worth mentioning is that he was technically the first player to sign the largest contract in NBA history up to that point; the first contract in NBA history to go over $100 million, it was a contract that the Bullets/Wizards could have decided to not get into a bidding war with the Heat who offered him a more lucrative contract, albeit one that stirred some controversy at the time and that the league itself nullified due to cap rules at the time and some mishaps regarding bonuses to Tim Hardaway and P.J. Brown.  Also Alonzo Mourning had an extension at around the same time which is a part of this debacle.  The whole saga is a lot more interesting than the contract itself and it's worth a Google if you're curious about it; I didn't even touch on how Washington eventually re-signed Howard and all the implications said signing had at the time.  

This went to court.  No really, lawyers got involved.

Over who could sign Juwan Howard.

It was weird.

**Amar’e Stoudemire - $100M, 5 year contract (2010)**

Another classic bad Knicks contract though this one isn't entirely fair to New York because Stoudemire was excellent in his first year in the Garden.  25/8/2, Amar'e was still his All-Star self and even helped the team make the playoffs for the first time since 2004!  

The rest of that contract's duration?  Injuries in the later years, the loss of the late acquisition of Chauncey Billups from the prior season and an iso-heavy offense running through Melo did not do Stoudemire any favors, and did I mention the injuries?  This honestly wouldn't have been such a bad signing were it not for them but it's not like the Knicks were unaware that Amar'e could be a risky signing due to injury given some of the wear and tear from his days in Phoenix; he already had two  major surgeries on different parts of his body up to that point and his knees had the fortitude of a wet chip.

Amar'e is one of the most influential 4s of the modern era and he was integral to the revolutionary 7SoL Suns but his stint with the Knicks started out hot and cooled off very quickly.  Yet another unfortunate case where injuries robbed a truly special talent of what could have been an even more impactful and lengthy career."

Was Michael Jordan’s defense and off-ball play also legendary?,nba,"I watched The Last Dance not too long ago, and recent discussions of fantastic &amp; terrible off-ball players (Steph Curry vs Trae Young), with Trae Young’s lack of defensive effort and prowess specifically being highlighted in addition to his off-ball deficiencies got me thinking.

As someone who was born and raised far past the era of MJ’s Bulls, all I really have as a reference point in regards to his basketball ability is how driven, consistently clutch, and athletically gifted he was. 

These traits most obviously translate to dominant scoring and playmaking. As a result, that’s what retrospectives such as The Last Dance tend to focus most on.

I don’t hear too much about his defensive skills, and he’s infamous for always being “the guy” with the ball in his hand. He’s always taking the last shot. That’s what the casual mainstream level of media coverage pushes in my experience, at least.

So I’m really curious, to anyone who was fortunate enough to be around during his prime, or someone with far more extensive knowledge than myself, was Jordan so well rounded to the point that even his defensive game &amp; off-ball play could qualify as the “best” in their respective categories? Do we not hear much about it because moving past screens &amp; well timed assists aren’t as sexy as dunks and buzzer beating jump shots? Or was he just mediocre in those areas, but so talented offensively it can’t be knocked too hard as a flaw? Like was he the reverse Ben Wallace?",t5_2qo4s,1486,252,"Was Michael Jordan’s defense and off-ball play also legendary?I watched The Last Dance not too long ago, and recent discussions of fantastic &amp; terrible off-ball players (Steph Curry vs Trae Young), with Trae Young’s lack of defensive effort and prowess specifically being highlighted in addition to his off-ball deficiencies got me thinking.

What is the best playoff series from teams where neither made the finals?,nba,"The question can also somewhat be rephrased as “what is the best first round or semifinals playoff series”. I initially thought to ask the question of the best playoff series from teams where neither won the championship, but this would include conference finals matchups which are generally more exciting and in some cases considered “the real NBA finals”.

Off the top of my head from recent memory + being a Laker fan, both the Grizzlies and Warriors series this past year were very exciting to watch with many storylines. I’m sure there’s ONE definite answer I can’t think of right now but what do ya’ll think.

Was Michael Jordan really 6'6 ?,nba,"Hi Everyone I recently discovered that Michael Jordan despite being listed at 6'6 is actually 6'4 3/4

Then I asked google to show me some images of MJ and Charles Barkley side by side and yea they are both the same height with the eye test ?

Do you think there has been over/under 2.5 billion pictures of Lebron James taken?,nba,"Things to think about:

Every single picture of him taken since December 30, 1984. 

Everytime someone takes a picture of him in the area that counts as one. 

If they take 10 in that span of a second, that counts as 10. 

Video recordings do not count. Screenshots of screen recordings do not count. 

If Lebron is in the picture and you can easily tell it’s him (like if it’s a picture of D. Wade, but Lebron is in the back warming up), that counts. 

If 2.5 billion is low, what’s a better over or under?


For me:

Just my thoughts. 

With 82 games a year (without playoffs), and let’s say 20,000 fans per game, let’s say everyone and their toddler takes 10 pics of Lebron.

82 x 20,000 = 1,640,000

1,640,000 x 10 = 16,400,000

16,400,000 x 20 (years)= 328,000,000.

What’s a player that your fanbase overrates to hell?,nba,"As a Lakers fan I feel ours is obvious. 

I very consistently get the “take off that flair” treatment for my stance on Kobe which is that he’s a top 12-15 player and not a top 5 player ever, which annoys me because the exact same parts of his game that other Lakers fans say made Kobe so great are things they criticize in other players.

James Harden is an analogy I like to use, not because they’re all that similar in either talent or playstyle, but the parts of their game that are glorified and criticized are polar opposite. 

With Harden it’s “he’s a chucker”, with Kobe it’s “killer instinct”. With Harden his foul baiting is “terrible for the sport” but with Kobe the rip through was “a high IQ play”. I’m not saying either side is right or wrong, but it pisses me off that it’s so inconsistent.

Luke Kennard Quietly Had One of the Best Shooting Seasons Ever. Can He Break the Record?,nba,"Last season Luke Kennard shot 49% from three, which grades as the ninth best three-point shooting performance of all time (shooting more threes per game than anyone above him too). However, what's even more intriguing is his production as a Grizzly. Once joining the Grizzlies, Kennard shot 5.7 threes a game and made 54% of them. This would have been statistically the best shooting performance of all time. While it was only 24 games, Coach Jenkins heavily stressed that he wants him shooting more than he ever has in his career and made it a point to draw up plays for him. 

After leading the NBA in 3pt% the past two seasons, what are the chances he can break the record officially? The current holder is Kyle Korver with 53.6% on 2.1 attempts per game. He's already proven he can sustain 54% on nearly 6 attempts a game, now he's just gotta do it for a full season. Breaking this record would solidify Kennard as one of the greatest shooters ever, and really get him some recognition as I believe he's been overlooked for the majority of his career. 

**Why he can do it:** With the green light from coach, the spacing with another elite shooter in Bane (2nd best 3pt% in 2021-22), and the facilitating from Ja, I think it's in the realm of possibility. When Ja is on the court, he can draw double teams and pull defenders closer to the basket, opening up opportunities for Luke. I also think Steven Adams being the best offensive rebounder in the league helps a lot with second chance open threes. 

**Why he can't:** Kyle Korver had the benefit of only shooting two threes a game and only played in 54 games the season he set the record. Luke shooting six a game and playing 82 games is already a massive disadvantage due to the sustainability and volume that could have an effect on his shooting. Steph Curry is widely considered the greatest shooter of all time and he's never even shot 46% due to volume. Luke's best chance at breaking a record like this is taking less shots which would be detrimental to his team.

At the end of the day, we haven't seen shooting this accurate since 2009, and this is on a much higher volume. Shooting 54% from three for a team in a season to my knowledge has never been done, so what he did as a Grizzly last year is already incredibly special. From all the stats I can find, nobody has shot as accurate as Kennard on 4.6+ three attempts a game **ever**. We are witnessing an all-time shooting performance and it's going pretty under the radar.

"[OC] Blake Griffin is still un-signed. If he doesn't land a job, it'll end one of the most impactful, underrated, infuriating, and misunderstood careers of his generation.",nba,"Now 34 years old, Blake Griffin is having trouble landing a job in free agency. If he does sign somewhere, it'll likely be in a reserve role. Last season for the Celtics, he played a total of 569 minutes in the regular season and only 6 minutes in the playoffs.

If Griffin's career ends with a whimper or a blurb buried at the bottom of ESPN, it'll be understating the impact of a player who had a major (albeit brief) influence on the league.

---


######**PART ONE: Instant Impact On the Court**

Playing for his local University of Oklahoma, Blake Griffin had a strong freshman year. He averaged 14.7 points (on 56.8% from the field) and 9.1 rebounds. The consensus from NBA scouts was that Griffin was a likely top lottery pick, and could have presumably climbed into the top 5-6 with strong workouts. 

However, Griffin must have felt there was still some work to do and still some upside on the table. He wasn't getting quite the national attention or draft respect he thought he may deserve, so he made the unconventional decision to return to college for his sophomore year. And there, Griffin removed all doubts that he had star potential. He put up monster numbers (22.7 points, 14.4 rebounds) and led the Sooners to a 30-6 record and an Elite Eight appearance. He was named the National Player of the Year and became the obvious # 1 pick in the draft.

Griffin got injured and missed his first year for the L.A. Clippers, setting up a highly-anticipated ""rookie"" season the following year. Griffin delivered -- and then some. That first year, Griffin averaged 22.5 points, 12.1 rebounds (a career high), and 3.8 assists. He was not only named as the easy ""Rookie of the Year,"" but he actually made the All-Star team and got on an MVP ballot -- finishing 10th overall.

Based on stats and accolades alone, you can argue that Blake Griffin had the best rookie season of the 2000s and perhaps the best since Tim Duncan.

---

######**PART TWO: Instant Impact Off the Court**

More impressive still, Blake Griffin did all that for the *Clippers*. It may be hard for younger NBA fans to understand how rotten the franchise had been at the time. The name ""Clippers"" was synonymous with ""sucks ass."" Since re-branding as the Clippers in 1978, the franchise made the playoffs 4 times. In 32 years. They were run by the deplorable and racist owner Donald Sterling, whose stink rotted the entire organization. At the time, the Clippers were the worst brand in the NBA.

That really did change with the arrival and optimism of Blake Griffin's prowess. Griffin became a star, and the fortunes turned for the franchise. The next year, the team traded for Chris Paul. Presumably, Paul wouldn't have agreed to join the team without a promising talent like Griffin on the roster. Two years later, the team hired Doc Rivers, whose stock was at an all-time high after his successful run with the Boston Celtics. Again, the idea that the *Clippers* could lure in a star coach would have been unthinkable a few years prior.

Thanks to Griffin (and Chris Paul, whose statistical impact can't be over-stated either), the Clippers went on an unprecedented run of success for the franchise. They won 50+ games five years in a row. And while that didn't result in an NBA Finals appearance, it did change the perception about the franchise. That only cemented a few years later, when Sterling was forced out and Steve Ballmer jumped in to provide stability (and deep pockets) to the team.

Right now, you'd put the Clippers into the ""glamor market"" tier -- a place where superstars may actually want to play. There are a variety of reasons why, but Blake Griffin's initial success did set the table for a lot of it. For that reason, his career goes behind numbers and W-L records and ranks as one of the most impactful in the broader NBA landscape.

---

######**PART THREE: An Underrated Skill Set**

When I suggest that Blake Griffin's career may be misunderstood or underrated, it's in regard to his actual basketball skill. There's a perception that Griffin came into the league as an ""athlete."" A dunker. In fact, his most defining basketball moment may have been his [Dunk Contest](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/blake-griffin-soars-over-car-to-win-slam-dunk-contest) win. And then, when he started to suffer injuries, he started to evolve his game to fit his declining athleticism.

That's not wholly true. The truth is, Griffin was *always* an underrated playmaker. He had great handles for his size and position and a good passing instinct. That's illustrated by his 3.8 assists as a rookie -- but also during the times when he was allowed to fully showcase his skill set.

When Chris Paul came to the team (in Griffin's second year) and took over the primary ballhandling duties, Griffin didn't always get the opportunity to show his full ""bag."" When he did take that alpha dog role, he shined. In 2013-14, CP3 missed 20 games due to injury, and Griffin responded with a career year and finished 3rd in MVP voting. 

We also saw that play out in 2018-19 after Griffin had lost a step and ended up in Detroit. It's largely a forgotten period in his career, but Griffin did have a brief standout stretch for the Pistons. That season, he averaged 24.5 points and 5.4 assists and helped a mediocre Detroit team make the playoffs.

These numbers -- a big averaging 4/5/6 assists -- don't really jump off the page in the modern NBA where we can see Nikola Jokic putting up 30/10/10 every night -- but they represent one of the better playmaking numbers for the PF position during that era.

---

######**PART FOUR: A Whole Bunch of Hypotheticals**

While Blake Griffin had a great NBA career and a good amount of team success with the Clippers, you can't help but wonder if they could have done more as a group together. ""What if?""

Maybe the team simply wasn't good enough. Maybe they'd never have won a title. But you can squint and see potential room for improvement from the club.

A lot of that is injury related, but I would say some of it was due to human error as well. The Clippers had a well-rounded starting four -- PG Chris Paul, SG J.J. Redick, PF Blake Griffin, and C DeAndre Jordan -- with an obvious hole in the middle at SF. It's a riddle that they were never quite able to solve as Matt Barnes started to age and decline.

The Clippers had some chances to fill it, but didn't take advantage. They cut Joe Ingles in training camp -- a heady well-rounded player that would have fit perfectly. They marginalized and traded a young Reggie Bullock -- another player who could have fit well as a 3+D wing.

Instead of taking a chance and developing young talent, Doc Rivers (as he's inclined to do) tapped the well of overrated and over-aged players instead. In Rivers' first year on the job as the coach and primary GM, he brought in a slew of over-the-hill veterans: Danny Granger (who was cooked by then), Big Baby Davis (same), Hedo Turkoglu (age 34), Stephen Jackson (age 35), and Antawn Jamison (age 37). All five of those players were out of the league by the end of the following year.

Rather than learn his lesson, Rivers kept striking out instead. He made the wrong choice repeatedly, falling back on old loyalties and biases rather than what was plainly in front of him. He over-played (and overpaid) his own son Austin Rivers as a result of that. But perhaps the epitome of Rivers' front office failures was the Clippers decision to bring in Paul Pierce (then age 38) at the tail end of his career. Sadly, it wasn't with the intention of using Pierce as a veteran mentor: it was with the intention of playing him minutes. At that age, Pierce wasn't up to the task. He shot 36.3% from the field and looked unplayable. Rather than realize that, Rivers started Pierce for 38 games. Somehow, the Clippers still won 51 games that year.

You do wonder what the Clippers could have been if they had a more competent coach in charge (or at least, had taken away Doc Rivers' personnel power earlier).

######**PART FIVE: Cruel Fate and Cruel Fists** 

It'd be incomplete to write about Blake Griffin's career and not mention the long list of injuries that's plagued him throughout. We can't blame that on Doc Rivers. 

(Well, maybe we can, if you factor in that the Clippers overplayed Griffin early in his career. Like Zion Williamson, he's a power player who plays with a lot of intensity, and requires a lighter touch than other stars).

Still, Griffin got hurt a lot and that may have been bound to happen regardless. We can also blame him specifically for the injury when he fractured his hand after punching a trainer.

There's also some ""inevitability"" to Griffin's limited career when you consider his body type. He's a thick guy, but he has a limited wingspan (at 6'11""). When you're not very long, you're going to be limited as a shot blocker regardless of your athleticism. We saw that play out in his NBA career -- where he's only averaged 0.5 blocks per game -- and we're seeing that play out with Zion Williamson in New Orleans now. 

If Griffin was a little taller or longer, teams would have been able to play him more often as a smallball ""big"" (which they probably should have done anyway). The one area where Griffin did adjust his game to fit his declining athleticism was by shooting more threes -- and he did that reasonably well -- but he couldn't overcome his lack of length in the same way. (He also got better at comedy!, going from a little overexposed early to solid comedic performer at the Comedy Central roasts).

######**TL; DR**

Overall, it'll be interesting to see how history remembers the career of Blake Griffin (if this is indeed the end for him). As mentioned, he had an oversized impact for his franchise early on, then eventually got derailed by injuries.

In terms of basketball, is he going to be a Hall of Famer? That's TBD. He's a six-time All-Star, but never made the Finals and never won MVP. Basketball-reference lists his Hall of Fame probability at 54.8%, which may be optimistic.

Still, I'd maintain that Blake Griffin had one of the most impactful, underrated, misunderstood, and infuriating careers in our era for a variety of reasons.",t5_2qo4s,10208,1748,"[OC] Blake Griffin is still un-signed. If he doesn't land a job, it'll end one of the most impactful, underrated, infuriating, and misunderstood careers of his generation.Now 34 years old, Blake Griffin is having trouble landing a job in free agency. If he does sign somewhere, it'll likely be in a reserve role. Last season for the Celtics, he played a total of 569 minutes in the regular season and only 6 minutes in the playoffs.

If Griffin's career ends with a whimper or a blurb buried at the bottom of ESPN, it'll be understating the impact of a player who had a major (albeit brief) influence on the league.

######**PART ONE: Instant Impact On the Court**

Playing for his local University of Oklahoma, Blake Griffin had a strong freshman year. He averaged 14.7 points (on 56.8% from the field) and 9.1 rebounds. The consensus from NBA scouts was that Griffin was a likely top lottery pick, and could have presumably climbed into the top 5-6 with strong workouts. 

However, Griffin must have felt there was still some work to do and still some upside on the table. He wasn't getting quite the national attention or draft respect he thought he may deserve, so he made the unconventional decision to return to college for his sophomore year. And there, Griffin removed all doubts that he had star potential. He put up monster numbers (22.7 points, 14.4 rebounds) and led the Sooners to a 30-6 record and an Elite Eight appearance. He was named the National Player of the Year and became the obvious # 1 pick in the draft.

Griffin got injured and missed his first year for the L.A. Clippers, setting up a highly-anticipated ""rookie"" season the following year. Griffin delivered -- and then some. That first year, Griffin averaged 22.5 points, 12.1 rebounds (a career high), and 3.8 assists. He was not only named as the easy ""Rookie of the Year,"" but he actually made the All-Star team and got on an MVP ballot -- finishing 10th overall.

Based on stats and accolades alone, you can argue that Blake Griffin had the best rookie season of the 2000s and perhaps the best since Tim Duncan.

---

######**PART TWO: Instant Impact Off the Court**

More impressive still, Blake Griffin did all that for the *Clippers*. It may be hard for younger NBA fans to understand how rotten the franchise had been at the time. The name ""Clippers"" was synonymous with ""sucks ass."" Since re-branding as the Clippers in 1978, the franchise made the playoffs 4 times. In 32 years. They were run by the deplorable and racist owner Donald Sterling, whose stink rotted the entire organization. At the time, the Clippers were the worst brand in the NBA.

That really did change with the arrival and optimism of Blake Griffin's prowess. Griffin became a star, and the fortunes turned for the franchise. The next year, the team traded for Chris Paul. Presumably, Paul wouldn't have agreed to join the team without a promising talent like Griffin on the roster. Two years later, the team hired Doc Rivers, whose stock was at an all-time high after his successful run with the Boston Celtics. Again, the idea that the *Clippers* could lure in a star coach would have been unthinkable a few years prior.

Thanks to Griffin (and Chris Paul, whose statistical impact can't be over-stated either), the Clippers went on an unprecedented run of success for the franchise. They won 50+ games five years in a row. And while that didn't result in an NBA Finals appearance, it did change the perception about the franchise. That only cemented a few years later, when Sterling was forced out and Steve Ballmer jumped in to provide stability (and deep pockets) to the team.

Right now, you'd put the Clippers into the ""glamor market"" tier -- a place where superstars may actually want to play. There are a variety of reasons why, but Blake Griffin's initial success did set the table for a lot of it. For that reason, his career goes behind numbers and W-L records and ranks as one of the most impactful in the broader NBA landscape.

---

######**PART THREE: An Underrated Skill Set**

When I suggest that Blake Griffin's career may be misunderstood or underrated, it's in regard to his actual basketball skill. There's a perception that Griffin came into the league as an ""athlete."" A dunker. In fact, his most defining basketball moment may have been his [Dunk Contest](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/blake-griffin-soars-over-car-to-win-slam-dunk-contest) win. And then, when he started to suffer injuries, he started to evolve his game to fit his declining athleticism.

That's not wholly true. The truth is, Griffin was *always* an underrated playmaker. He had great handles for his size and position and a good passing instinct. That's illustrated by his 3.8 assists as a rookie -- but also during the times when he was allowed to fully showcase his skill set.

When Chris Paul came to the team (in Griffin's second year) and took over the primary ballhandling duties, Griffin didn't always get the opportunity to show his full ""bag."" When he did take that alpha dog role, he shined. In 2013-14, CP3 missed 20 games due to injury, and Griffin responded with a career year and finished 3rd in MVP voting. 

We also saw that play out in 2018-19 after Griffin had lost a step and ended up in Detroit. It's largely a forgotten period in his career, but Griffin did have a brief standout stretch for the Pistons. That season, he averaged 24.5 points and 5.4 assists and helped a mediocre Detroit team make the playoffs.

These numbers -- a big averaging 4/5/6 assists -- don't really jump off the page in the modern NBA where we can see Nikola Jokic putting up 30/10/10 every night -- but they represent one of the better playmaking numbers for the PF position during that era.

######**PART FOUR: A Whole Bunch of Hypotheticals**

While Blake Griffin had a great NBA career and a good amount of team success with the Clippers, you can't help but wonder if they could have done more as a group together. ""What if?""

Maybe the team simply wasn't good enough. Maybe they'd never have won a title. But you can squint and see potential room for improvement from the club.

A lot of that is injury related, but I would say some of it was due to human error as well. The Clippers had a well-rounded starting four -- PG Chris Paul, SG J.J. Redick, PF Blake Griffin, and C DeAndre Jordan -- with an obvious hole in the middle at SF. It's a riddle that they were never quite able to solve as Matt Barnes started to age and decline.

The Clippers had some chances to fill it, but didn't take advantage. They cut Joe Ingles in training camp -- a heady well-rounded player that would have fit perfectly. They marginalized and traded a young Reggie Bullock -- another player who could have fit well as a 3+D wing.

Instead of taking a chance and developing young talent, Doc Rivers (as he's inclined to do) tapped the well of overrated and over-aged players instead. In Rivers' first year on the job as the coach and primary GM, he brought in a slew of over-the-hill veterans: Danny Granger (who was cooked by then), Big Baby Davis (same), Hedo Turkoglu (age 34), Stephen Jackson (age 35), and Antawn Jamison (age 37). All five of those players were out of the league by the end of the following year.

Rather than learn his lesson, Rivers kept striking out instead. He made the wrong choice repeatedly, falling back on old loyalties and biases rather than what was plainly in front of him. He over-played (and overpaid) his own son Austin Rivers as a result of that. But perhaps the epitome of Rivers' front office failures was the Clippers decision to bring in Paul Pierce (then age 38) at the tail end of his career. Sadly, it wasn't with the intention of using Pierce as a veteran mentor: it was with the intention of playing him minutes. At that age, Pierce wasn't up to the task. He shot 36.3% from the field and looked unplayable. Rather than realize that, Rivers started Pierce for 38 games. Somehow, the Clippers still won 51 games that year.

You do wonder what the Clippers could have been if they had a more competent coach in charge (or at least, had taken away Doc Rivers' personnel power earlier).

we gave up a first round pick and LUKE KENNARD for like 20 games of geriatric eric gordon, and then he went to the suns. this is the worst one in my opinion cause he got cooked in every playoff game 

now we won’t trade tmann for harden. i love tmann but ty lue doesn’t even play him or trust him so what’s the point of keeping him on the team"

"If Elon Musk Owned An NBA Team, How Many Teams Would Have A Worse Owner Than Him?",nba,"At this point, it's fair to say the Tesla owner, Zuckerberg-dodging dork has fully shattered his image as tech nerd's favorite billionaire, with said image replaced with one of incompetence, laughability and in general showcasing poor management and even worse ideas.

He is very bad at the whole ""running a company"" thing, exemplified by his tumultuous tenure of meddling, firings and so on with Twitter, to say nothing about the horrendous rebranding of it into X, among other failed business ventures that led to him being outed as CEO from several companies such as PayPal and Zip2.

This got me thinking about the NBA owners and who some of the worst are/have been for years and how they compare to Musk were he to, say, own one of the eagerly anticipated expansion teams.

Some of the worst (current) owners include, in no particular order...

**Jody Allen, Blazers** \- From one of the more passionate owners in her brother Paul to one of the least.  A bone-smuggling, alleged sexual harasser, Jody oversaw the Blazers front office become a cesspool of  toxicity and players of increasing unhappiness.  I'm not just referring to Dame and the slow breakup of him and the Blazers, Gary Trent Jr. was reportedly ""depressed"" and ""played with so much pain"" for Portland's team according to his father.

The formation of a [toxic workplace/culture](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/03/1061295224/portland-trail-blazers-general-manager-neil-olshey-fired) is something you're going to see pop up a lot with these teams, by the way.

**Marc Cuban, Mavericks** \- Cuban is lucky the Mavericks won in 2011 because it made everyone forget that he broke up the dynamic duo of Dirk and future 2x MVP Steve Nash despite the two of them going deep into the playoffs.  Beyond wondering how the 2006 Finals would have looked were Cuban willing to pay Nash what he was worth, there's also the immediate breaking up of the 2011 Mavericks core in an attempt to free up cap space for a big name free agent and season after season of star chasing that never ended up yielding Dirk a co-star in his twilight years.

It is also worth mentioning that in 2018, [an investigation into Dallas' workplace](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/02/21/dallas-mavericks-sexual-misconduct-investigation-mark-cuban-response)was published.  It cited a predatory, misogynistic environment fostered by an immature manchild of an owner that was described as an ""animal house"", including allegations of domestic abuse unrelated to the well known abuse involving their current head coach, Jason Kidd.

**The DeVos family, Magic** \- Orlando has actually been run rather well of late - their fleecing of the Bulls is a testament to that - and their young core is amongst the more promising in the league.  That is largely in spite of the DeVos family's ownership who you might have recently learned about them owning the team - which has a predominantly black roster - after donating $50,000 to Ron DeRacist's campaign.

Beyond that, it shouldn't be forgotten how bad their post-Dwight, pre-Paolo rebuild ended up being, peaking at a first round exit as the 7th seed, albeit to the eventual champions in 2019, after putting their fans through hell for about 5 years.

**James Dolan, Knicks** \- Like the Magic, the Knicks have been run relatively well as of late.  That's good for them but it stands in contrast to the meddling and incompetence that Dolan was constantly responsible for post-Ewing.  Bad trades, massive overpays for washed players, botched draft picks, you name it, he's been a part of it.  Needless to say that if Dolan were still meddling, the Knicks would have thrown every pick and player asked of them for Donovan Mitchell.  Prolly even some young guys they were never asked to.

Even with the more hands-off approach, James managed to embroil the Knicks in controversy last season with his [employment of facial recognition software](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/02/james-dolan-madison-square-garden-move-saga-face-recognition) to intimidate people who are critical of his thin-skinned self on social media or the like.  He also kicked out Charles Oakley, a player who was with the team for over a decade, in the middle of a game and temporarily banned them from attending Knicks games.  And no, this isn't even the weirdest story involving Dolan and a Knicks player; just ask Carmelo Anthony about Dolan's staff spying on him.

Dolan hasn't been as bad *of* *late* but historically, few owners have the lengthy resume of futility and atrocious decision-making that Dolan does.  He deserves special consideration due to also owning the WNBA team New York Liberty (aka. a women's basketball team) at the time when hiring Isiah Thomas to run the team despite Thomas engaging in sexual harassment during his time with the Knicks in the 00s.  This was a particularly infamous case that ended up with a jury ruling in favor of Anucha Browne Sanders, a former woman executive of the Knicks who was fired after complaining about said sexual harassment, rewarding her nearly $12 million dollar in damages.

I eagerly await being banned from the garden for posting this.  Sell the team, Dolan.

**Vivek Ranadivé, Kings** \- I feel like the recent season of competence we've seen from the Kings in the 2022/23 season has made a lot of people forget how horrible the Kings have been.  Not all of the nearly two decades of basement-dwelling was Ranadivé's fault but since owning the team in 2013, it most certainly was.  Poor hiring decisions for the front office, awful trades and a failure to build around one of the few players that wasn't a draft bust during said tenure in DeMarcus Cousins, it should go without saying that being a fan of the Beam Team was excruciating, and while the Haliburton trade is now seen as a win-win, it cannot be understated how bad the move looked at the time when the Kings were 12th in the standings at the time and 12th come the season's end.

Once again, there's [allegations of a toxic work environment](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10032227-former-kings-employee-says-sacramento-has-toxic-workplace-and-is-basketball-hell) and mistreatment of staff, allegations that remain rather recent - a former employee made said allegations in 2022 - and should not be overlooked despite the otherwise optimistic and refreshing season Sacramento had last year.

*Honorable Mention*: **Michael Jordan, Hornets** \- The GOAT is no longer up for the crown amongst atrocious ownership but let it not be said that he didn't leave his mark on the franchise.  Quite literally up to the last minute as he had the final say on choosing Brandon Miller over Scoot Henderson, a decision which may seem to early to judge as a mistake were it not for MJ's historically awful drafting pedigree that dates back to his days with the Wizards.  Also a ton of overpay contracts for which Charlotte is still literally paying for to this day as Gordon Hayward enters the final year of his $120 million contract ($31.5M for this year).

So of these many owners, which ones were/are as bad as Elon Musk would be in this hypothetical?  I think James Dolan's record firmly places him as the worst current owner even with him not meddling in team affairs like he used to.",t5_2qo4s,7249,1175,"If Elon Musk Owned An NBA Team, How Many Teams Would Have A Worse Owner Than Him?At this point, it's fair to say the Tesla owner, Zuckerberg-dodging dork has fully shattered his image as tech nerd's favorite billionaire, with said image replaced with one of incompetence, laughability and in general showcasing poor management and even worse ideas.

What are the chances of Austin Reaves being an all-star in the next 5 years?,nba,"Based on how he performed for Team USA, how do you feel about Austin Reaves's chances of making the All-Star team within the next 5 years?

First off, he's a good playmaker and a very efficient scorer from the perimeter, as well as a great foul-baiter. He is the scoring guard LeBron needs and will cook when the game calls for it.

Second, he's a starting guard for the Los Angeles Lakers which will help him get the votes he needs esp when someone is injured. The fact that Steve Kerr got him in Team USA means he's gonna be loved by the coaches as well if he plays up to standards.

Which NBA player would benefit the most from being 3” taller/shorter?,nba,"Was thinking about how Kobe said how lucky everyone is that AI wasn’t 6’5” and was wondering whose game would benefit the most from being a little shorter or taller. Someone like MJ would have been insane at 6’9” but I don’t think it would have made him significantly more dominant since he would likely lose a little agility with being taller. 

There are a lot of interesting shorter guys who would have been even greater with some more height and I even think a guy like Yao would have benefitted from being a little shorter.

Explain the difference in fan perspective to an English football(soccer) fan,nba,"I have somewhat followed NBA basketball over the years but never to the same extent as I follow football(soccer to you guys) but the aspect of basketball I don't quite understand is the general aversion to the most skilled players linking up and forming ""super teams"", even amongst the fans of the said superteam and the overall feeling that playing alongside other stars diminishes the credibility of your accolades. 

Conversely, football fans and management are often calling for their teams to try and form what would essentially be equivalent to a super team by grouping the most talented stars together.

Anthony Davis Joins $60M Club,nba,"Lakers star, Anthony Davis, officially enters the $60M club.

Last week, the big man lands the richest annual extension in NBA history as he has agreed on a three-year $186M max extension.

There is no denying how dominant Anthony Davis is on the court, however, the inconsistency is what’s frustrating. The elite big man has only played in 194 of 318 games as a Laker (61%).

Breaking it down even further, Anthony Davis has played an average of 60 games per season since being drafted in 2012. If he keeps that up, he will be making over $1M per game on his new $186M extension.

Let’s take a look at his projected salary for the next 5 years:

2023-24: $40.6M  
2024-25: $43.2M  
2025-26: $57.6M  
2026-27: $62.2M  
2027-28: $66.8M

Not only will he have earned about $500M on the court alone by age 34, but he will join Damian Lillard in the $60M club when 2027 rolls around.

FYI: I do not take ownership in these numbers/stats as I found them on the web from my sport business sources ([Courtsidefocus](https://www.courtsidefocus.com/subscribe)). ",t5_2qo4s,1053,171,"Anthony Davis Joins $60M ClubLakers star, Anthony Davis, officially enters the $60M club.

-  55/40/72 splits
-  Overcame a 3-1 deficit (in 2016)

Here's some more numbers for nerds:

- 62.5 ts% (+9.8 rTS) based off league ts% vs warriors 16-18
- Had 4 of the top 15 highest gamescores in NBA finals history.
- Had 3 games over a BPM of 20 (game 5-6 2016 &amp; game 1 in 2018 finals)

"Do people actually believe in the ""Nuggets got it easy by not playing the Bucks or Celtics in the final"" idea?",nba,"When some people discuss the most recent championship the asterisk for Denver is ""All they did was play low seeds so it was easy for them"". I'm a Nuggets fan so there's obviously bias on my end but from a logic POV how does this make any sense? So the 8th seed Heat (who dealt with injuries) defeated both the 1st and 2nd seed Bucks and Celtics in the playoff rounds leading to the final, which the Nuggets would then beat Miami for the championship. But if the Nuggets played teams who were proven to be worse - the Bucks or Celtics, it would have been more difficult for them and a more competitive finals series? 

Again how does this logic make any sense? Why didn't Milwaukee or Boston just beat Miami if they were worthy finals teams? And it's not like the Bucks had the ""Giannis was also injured"" excuse, they dropped 140 points on the Heat without him and should have 100% won the series regardless. And as for the 7th seed Lakers, they changed their squad and instantly improved their team half way through the season to be a top 4 team in the west. So if they played the 2nd seed Grizzlies, who lost to the Lakers in the first round, or the Kings who lost to a team the Lakers would also beat in the 2nd round, those teams would have gave Denver more trouble?

######**category 1: the leftovers**

**Wes Unseld Jr., Washington Wizards**

It's a difficult situation when a new general manager takes over and inherits a head coach. Almost always, that GM is going to want to hire ""his own guy"" at some point. Of course, they have to wait until a proper justification to fire the existing coach.

At this point, it's hard to blame Wes Unseld Jr. for the middling results of his Washington team. He's been given a below-average roster, and he's delivered below-average results (35-47 and 35-47 in back to back years). What complicates the math from here is that Unseld shouldn't be expected to do any better this year after the team traded away Bradley Beal. And they may not *want* to do much better if the goal is to rebuild and get a top pick in the draft.

So what can Unseld Jr. do to keep his job? I don't think it'll be about wins and losses. There's not going to be a big difference between 25 wins, 30 wins, 35 wins, it's all about the same in the long run. I'd say that Unseld needs to prove his worth and show that he has some tangible value to a team, and that would likely come on the defensive end. He came to the Wizards with a reputation as a defensive specialist, but his defenses have ranked # 25 and # 21 respectively in his first two years. But if Unseld can coach this group up to a **top 20 defense**, then that would give him a solid chance of survival. You don't need ""A+"" talent to play hard on the defensive end, so that's a reasonable goal for this team. 

---

**Steve Clifford, Charlotte Hornets**

A coach is always in danger when there's a new GM in town, and that's doubly true when there's a new owner in town. The Hornets might be in line for a makeover, and that may not include the 61-year-old Steve Clifford. Heck, he wasn't even the old administration's first choice for the job to begin with (that would have been Kenny Atkinson, who slipped away at the last second).

Fortunately for Steve Clifford, he has some faint pathway to survival here. Despite the 27-55 record last year, the team isn't *that* bad. Last season was a nightmare, but they'll have LaMelo Ball back to full strength (after playing just 36 games). They'll have Miles Bridges back (and pretend to forget why he was gone). Sophomore Mark Williams may take a big step up and be an anchor down low. I don't think the play-in alone would be enough to keep Clifford safe, but if the team can **finish around .500**, that'd make it hard to fire Clifford. It'd mean an improvement of 15 games and put Clifford on the fringes of Coach of the Year talk. 

---

**Chauncey Billups, Portland Trail Blazers**

Damian Lillard distanced himself from the Chauncey Billups hiring as soon as the team got flak for it, but he was no doubt a large reason why the franchise brought in the respected floor general in the first place. Billups was also supposed to help on the defensive end. So far, it hasn't gone according to plan.

If Lillard exits now, where does that leave Chauncey Billups? Where does that leave GM Joe Cronin? The whole situation  feels like a trainwreck that would require a cleanup crew afterwards -- and makes their departure feel somewhat inevitable. 

At the same time, there is some glimmer of hope here. If Damian Lillard leaves (for a minimal return), that'd leave a wide open lane for rookie Scoot Henderson to come barreling through. It's not outrageous to think that he can compete for 20 PPG and a Rookie of the Year trophy. And if **Scoot Henderson wins Rookie of the Year**, a lot of those bad vibes would go away. Alternatively, if Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe look lost, then you'd expect the team to shed Billups and find a more proven coach going forward.

######**category 2: stuck in the middle with you**

**Jacque Vaughn, Brooklyn Nets**

It's easy to say that the Brooklyn Nets don't have any expectations at this point after losing Kevin Durant. And Kyrie Irving. And James Harden. This is a rebuilding situation, right?

Well... not entirely. This isn't as young of a team as you may expect. Later this month, Mikal Bridges will turn 27, matching the age of Cam Johnson and Ben Simmons. Those aren't young prospects -- those are players expected to be in their primes. Meanwhile, 3+D wings Dorian Finney-Smith and Royce O'Neale are already 30. This is a team that's good enough and old enough to compete for the playoffs.

I don't necessarily know if the Nets need to **make the playoffs** for Jacque Vaughn to keep his job, but it sure wouldn't hurt. If not, the team will likely make some big moves in the offseason -- either cashing in their chips for a star or going into a full rebuild instead. In either case, they may remake the coaching staff as well.

---

**Billy Donovan, Chicago Bulls**

Billy Donovan may be in a similar situation in Chicago. In fact, his roster is even older. If the Bulls **make the playoffs**, you can justify their decision to keep on chugging. If they fall short of that, it feels inevitable that the team will finally embrace a tear-down and rebuild.

If that happens, it may be a mutual decision to part ways. Donovan's background is in the NCAA so in theory he'd be well-suited to develop a young roster. At the same time, he's 58 years old and he'd have already coached for 9 years in the NBA. Does he have the patience for a reset? Would the team want young blood instead? All in all, it feels like this may be a make or break season for Donovan and the Bulls' sense of stagnation.

---


######**category 3: put up or shut up**

**Jason Kidd, Dallas Mavericks**

Owner Mark Cuban has a man-crush on Jason Kidd (who helped the team win a title as a player), but there's a limit to how far that affection can take you. If the Mavs don't improve drastically from their 38-44 record, then you'd have to expect a housecleaning here. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the Mavs need to **win a playoff series** for Kidd to feel totally safe in this situation.

Winning a series (or at least, making it competitive) isn't unrealistic for this team. There are some question marks about the center position and about the depth, but they have elite top-end talent in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Doncic is arguably a top 5 player in the league. And for all the criticism Irving gets, he's been lights out offensively over the last few years. If Grant Williams can come in and maintain his shooting from the corners (42.7% for his career), this offense should be one of the league's best. If they don't... Luka Doncic may be unhappy... which means Mark Cuban may be unhappy... which means Kidd may be in trouble.

---

**Willie Green, New Orleans Pelicans**

Although the New Orleans Pelicans didn't make the playoffs either, there are going to be high expectations for this club. They finished 42-40 despite only getting 29 games from Zion Williamson. No one's counting on Williamson to play a full 82, but he should at least play *more* than that. In theory.

If he does, this team is chocked full of talent -- both in terms of high-end stars but also in terms of depth. I suspect Willie Green will need to make the most of that and at least **make the playoffs** (health permitting). If they fall short again, it may be time for a more experienced hand. The market isn't great, but the roster's good enough to draw in some top coaching candidates.

---

**Joe Mazzulla, Boston Celtics**

In his first year on the job, Joe Mazzulla finished 57-25 and made the Eastern Conference Finals. For 95% of franchises, that'd be a home run. Instead, it got him all sorts of criticism for underachieving.

This year, Mazzulla should be bolstered by an even stronger roster and a stronger support staff, which will now include Charles Lee and Sam Cassell. In some ways, that's a double-edged sword. Perhaps more than any other coach, Mazzulla needs to ""win now"" -- as in, in the Fall and Winter of 2023. If the team stumbles out of the gates (let's say they have an 8-10 record), he may well be fired and replaced by Lee or Cassell.

Presuming the Celtics roll into the playoffs, the bar should still be high. In fact, I'd suspect Mazzulla will only feel comfortable if the team **makes the Finals**. Anything less will seem like a disappointment. Fortunately for Maz, all the talent's here to make that run.",t5_2qo4s,8668,1504,"[OC] Temperature Check -- What do ""Hot Seat"" Coaches Need to do to Survive?No NBA coach has tenure.

And I'm really confident in it. Idk how no one else sees it when he's so young, with Arms as long as T Mac at 7'2"", but also somehow 6'4"" and 235 lbs, 25 lbs heavier than a pretty big PG himself, at 6'3"" 210 Deron Williams.

Realistically does Carmelo Anthony get his number retired anywhere?,nba,"He started his career in Denver wearing #15 but when he left they let some random second round pick from Serbia named Nikola Jokic wear it so he's not getting his number retired in Denver

He played for the Knicks but only made the playoffs 3 times and got bounced in the first round 2 out of the 3 times. He never made it past the second round. For a historic franchise like the Knicks it seems like a really low bar but maybe I'm wrong. The Knicks are literally one of the original teams and actually won the very first NBA game ever played. The Knicks have been around since the formation of the league and I'm not really sure if Carmelo Anthony has enough to warrant a Jersey in the rafters.

I might be totally wrong but it seems more unlikely than likely that he doesn't end up with a number retired.",t5_2qo4s,806,152,"Realistically does Carmelo Anthony get his number retired anywhere?He started his career in Denver wearing #15 but when he left they let some random second round pick from Serbia named Nikola Jokic wear it so he's not getting his number retired in Denver

All-Time Starting Five (stylistic fit - modern rules),nba,"PG - Steph Curry: Modern rules limiting contact against shooters and making defense less effective make Steph the best option here. Off-ball motion, passing, and shooting are all aspects of his game that make everyone around him better.

SG - Michael Jordan: I think Jordan may be a little overconfident for a team like this, but I can't put Kobe over him in good conscience. As above, the modern game emphasizes freedom of motion and scoring. Jordan's Off-ball movement is underrated, and his constant rim pressure would work very well next to Steph Curry specifically, especially considering the next 2 spots.

SF - Kevin Durant: KD's game is built for playing alongside superstars in the modern game.(shocker, I know) His size doesn't limit his effectiveness in a less physical game, and his ability to shoot from anywhere on the court while not being limited agility-wise would make him a dangerous off-ball threat no matter where he was on the court. Defensively, I also think it's worth mentioning that Durant has shown a greater willingness to play high level defense when his offensive load is lighter. In Golden State, he became a better shot blocker and inside presence overall while Steph and Klay could handle the offensive load without him being actively involved.

PF - Larry Bird: Definitely an uncommon choice at the 4 spot. Bird and Durant have very similar games, however, Bird is a better rebounder and is more floor-bound; which wouldn't be as much of a problem at the 4 as it would at the 3. In the modern game, Bird's IQ, shooting ability, and passing are more valuable than they even were in the 80's, while his defensive shortcomings are less important. Bird is also capable of hitting shots from all over the floor, and having a more effective post game at the 4 spot could be easily integrated to shake the offense up.

C - Kevin Garnett: Another unconventional choice. In the early 2000's, KG had to deal with centers like Shaq and David Robinson, and  could not effectively play that role. In 2023, KG is as reasonable a center as any. KG has shooting ability, can single-handedly anchor a defense on the inside, and would not have to deal with extensive rule changes. (Which is why Bill Russell and Wilt did not make the cut here) While we didn't get much of a chance to see it, KG was also a talented playmaker who would work better alongside HoF talent than more offensively oriented centers like Olajuwon or Shaq.

Got a good idea for a rule change,nba,"You know how players always wait until like a split second after a buzzer sounds to hoist up an end or quarter half or full court shot? So it doesn’t hurt their % but they want it to look like it was an accident?

What if the nba started only counting it as a shot attempt if it went in? Like they do for shooting fouls. So if it misses, it’s like it never happened. 

It would be more exciting if guys other than Steph and Dame were actually attempting those heaves consistently. 

Could also provide some laughs like this Jarrett Jack attempt 🤣

My Hot/Lukewarm Takes,nba,"1. Load management is not an issue. Player availability is decided by team medical staff. The increase in injuries has been occurring since the 90s and is a result of prolonged wear-and tear from AAU and youth basketball. Stop calling players soft, they're genuinely unable to play.

2. LeBron is the best scorer of all time. At minimum tied for top 3 or so. But you can't prove someone's better.

3. Superteams work well. Stacking all stars is the best route to winning a chip.

4. Anyone that devalues old legends' stats because old NBA was ""plumbers"" is wrong. Old stars had no one to learn from. If modern stars grew up in that era they'd be worse, and if old stars had modern training they'd be better.

5. Stephen Curry clearly deserves 3 FMVP ('15, '18, '22)

6. KD joining the warriors was, coincidentally, the most impactful decision in basketball history. It destroyed both Lebron and Curry's legacies, and it destroyed what would have easily been the globe's biggest sporting rivalry at the time (cavs v gsw).

Who peaked higher: Nikola Jokic or Kevin Durant?,nba,"**Durant**

Kevin Durant is hailed as arguably the greatest scorer in NBA history due to his ability to score from quite literally anywhere on the floor, at a *very* high rate, in any which way. He also has 4 scoring titles to help his case. He hasn't won one since 2014 primarily due to injuries and star-studded rosters (I mean this in a very positive manner) which do not require him to score a million points every night. It would probably be a detriment to the team if Durant just ISO'd every play.

Durant was always in the conversation for best player in the league but could never quite get the title due to LeBron being at his peak and prime literally throughout KD's **entire career**, however gained notoriety for it after his title wins, with the bulk of it coming in 2019 after he was going nuts with a struggling Curry and LeBron out of the playoffs. His best case was after the Bucks series when he put up monster performances after his teammates went down, and people seriously considered him the best as the Bucks would've gotten white-washed if they were healthy. This time range can be from 2018-2021.

**The Joker**

Jokic came onto the scene much later, as his case for best player in the league laughably came during these playoffs, even though he was the **back-to-back MVP**, and only lost because he and the team threw in the towel towards the end of the season with Perkins running an anti-Jokic campaign on the outside.

He was clearly the best player in the postseason (honourably mention to Curry and Butler), and completely DOMINATED every team he played in ways I haven't really seen Durant do. He is clearly at his peak (or close to it). The one thing that is not in his favour is reps. He needs to have a bit more longevity to solidify his greatness.

For a select few, it may be the difference between getting their second contract or the difference between being taken seriously as a star or written off as a disappointment for one another. 

You never like to see young guys fail so early into their tenure as an NBA player.  Here are but a few for whom the next season might be their most important in their career.

  
**Kira Lewis Jr.** 

**22/23 Stats - 4.6/1.3/1.9 on 45/44/86 splits**

A pending RFA on the Pelicans, New Orleans is allegedly trying to find them a new place.  One hopes that Kira is able to break out elsewhere because they were not able to carve out a spot in the rotation, losing minutes in their 3rd year to a rookie named after a vacuum and only playing an average of 9 minutes.  
**Malachi Flynn** 

**22/23 Stats - 4.6/1.4/1.3 on 36/35/76 splits**

Flynn's decent rookie season seems like an outlier after failing to find  a role on a Raptors team that desperately needed (and still does!) a backup point guard, to say nothing of shooting that Flynn should, in theory, provide.  With the loss of Fred VanVleet and a change to a head coach that presumably doesn't hate him, there are neither excuses nor lack of opportunity for Malachi.  If he doesn't make the most of it, it would be shocking to see him get a 2nd contract.  
**Killian Hayes**

**22/23 Stats - 10.2/2.9/6.2 on 38/28/82 splits**

It almost feels like cheating to include Hayes because the same  thing was said about him last year when the Pistons lost Cade Cunningham to injury.  The only difference is he's - you guessed it - in a contract year and is almost certainly not getting extended, let alone a serious offer in free agency next year unless he can show any improvement.

  
**James Wiseman**

**22/23 Stats - 10/5.9/0.7 on 56/20/70 splits**

No, not every name on this list is going to be an upcoming RFA from the 2020 draft class but James Wiseman is especially worth noting because he is battling for his minutes against the similarly athletic  bigs on Detroit's roster in Jalen Duren and Marvin Bagley, and while both of them have their flaws - Bagley in particular is another candidate to consider for this list - none of them make one cry via their advanced stats like James Wiseman does.  Given how much he's making as the former 2nd overall pick from that draft, James is going to have to seriously impress in order to receive a second contract on par with what he's being paid in his final year.

&amp;#x200B;

**James Bouknight**

**22/23 Stats - 5.6/2.1/1.2 on 36/30/67 splits**

It's too soon to write off Charlotte's DUI-doing shooting guard as a bust but when one compares him to his fellow lottery picks from the 2021 draft, even the ones who had their own notable sophomore slumps, Bouknight stands out for all the wrong reasons.  A shooter who can't shoot and rarely available - he played a combined 60 games over the past 2 seasons - the best thing one could say about his prior season was it let the Hornets be bad enough for a high draft pick that will likely come to haunt the franchise for passing over Scoot Henderson as it was used on Brandon Miller instead.  

That last part admittedly wasn't his fault, granted, but the point still stands:  Bouknight is rapidly approaching bust territory and with the addition of the promising Nick Smith Jr. to the roster, James' position in Charlotte's backcourt rotation looks incredibly insecure going into the season.

&amp;#x200B;

**Patrick Williams**

**22/23 Stats - 10.2/4.0/1.2 on 46/42/86 splits**

Another 2020 draftee, Patrick Williams is in perhaps the most precarious position of those mentioned.  Considering that one of these players is on the Hornets, that is saying a lot.  Stuck on a Bulls team trying to contend with DeMar/LaVine/Vucevic all higher in the pecking order that's had a painfully poor record of developing its talent, Williams isn't going to get the same opportunities that others on this list might and his chances of being a tank commander are equally lacking in promise but whatever opportunities he can get, he needs to take them to prove the flashes he's shown are a sign of something greater than he currently is.

  
**Zion Williamson**

**22/23 Stats - 26/7/4.6 on 61/37/71 splits**

When he's on the court, he's an MVP candidate, so Zion doesn't have to prove himself like the above in the same way.  He just has to prove he can stay healthy for most of a given season.  He was on the floor for 29 games last year, missed out on the whole season prior and all but 24 games in his rookie season.  61 games in his sophomore season is his career high and seemingly an exception at that.    


**Ben Simmons**

**22/23 Stats - 6.9/6.3/6.1 on 57/0/44 splits**

It feels weird to list arguably the most accomplished player (Note:  ""Accomplished"" doesn't mean ""best"") on this list at the end but Ben is in a particularly unique circumstance.  On a Brooklyn team that has to build around the margins and a hefty contract that would make it difficult for anyone else to take a flier on him, the former 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team and Jenner enthusiast, one would hope the young socialite will have a healthier season than the past two so we can see if there's a training arc in Ben that leads to the best version of himself. At 27 years old, time is very much against him but it's not as if late blooming point guards like Chauncey Billups and Kyle Lowry are nonexistent.

Is Jokic a Top 5 offensive player of all time?,nba,"When it comes to **PEAK**, do you think Jokic is a Top 5 offensive player of all time?


I probably have LeBron and Jordan above him. 


Larry vs Jokic: Jokic with his 3 year peak, probably surpasses Larry in terms of offense. Larry is the GOAT of the regular season but he has noticeable playoff drops which Jokic rarely has. He's probs better a better offensive player than Larry because of his sustained high efficiency on the floor with less help. Jokic is also a better playoff performer offensively.



Jokic vs Magic: Magic is probably the better playmaker but Jokic is easily the better scorer so I have Jokic over Magic offensively IMO.



Jokic vs Curry: They're both hyper efficient but Jokic is a way better traditional playmaker. I have Jokic slightly ahead offensively.



Jokic vs Kareem: Kareem is a better scorer for his era. Jokic is a better playmaker and it ain't close. But this is a really close one. I'd slightly lean Jokic because he played in a more competitive era.



Jokic vs Shaq: This one is also close. Shaq had more gravity and was more dominant. Both were hyper efficient but Jokic spaced the floor more but you cannot physically stop Shaq. It's a tie for the both of them.



Jokic vs Duncan: Jokic is easily the better offensive player.



Jokic vs Hakeem: Jokic is the better scorer and a better playmaker. Therefore, Jokic is easily the better offensive player.



Jokic vs Wilt: According to Thinking Basketball, Wilt's 50 point season is overrated and eye test wise, Jokic clears. More on that later.



Jokic vs Bill: Not even close.




In conclusion, the Top 5 offensive players are in no order: LeBron, Jordan, Kareem, Shaq, Jokic.


 Jokic is at least a Top 5 offensive player if you consider how great his efficiency is and his brilliant playmaking all together while not having a GOATED supporting cast.",t5_2qo4s,1849,308,"Is Jokic a Top 5 offensive player of all time?When it comes to **PEAK**, do you think Jokic is a Top 5 offensive player of all time?


I probably have LeBron and Jordan above him. 


Larry vs Jokic: Jokic with his 3 year peak, probably surpasses Larry in terms of offense. Larry is the GOAT of the regular season but he has noticeable playoff drops which Jokic rarely has. He's probs better a better offensive player than Larry because of his sustained high efficiency on the floor with less help. Jokic is also a better playoff performer offensively.



Jokic vs Magic: Magic is probably the better playmaker but Jokic is easily the better scorer so I have Jokic over Magic offensively IMO.



Jokic vs Curry: They're both hyper efficient but Jokic is a way better traditional playmaker. I have Jokic slightly ahead offensively.



Jokic vs Kareem: Kareem is a better scorer for his era. Jokic is a better playmaker and it ain't close. But this is a really close one. I'd slightly lean Jokic because he played in a more competitive era.



Jokic vs Shaq: This one is also close. Shaq had more gravity and was more dominant. Both were hyper efficient but Jokic spaced the floor more but you cannot physically stop Shaq. It's a tie for the both of them.



Jokic vs Duncan: Jokic is easily the better offensive player.

"Why don't people put Westbrook in the conversation of ""changing the game""?",nba,"We always hear how Steph changed the game with three-point shooting. But what about Westbrook?

"""People want to compare me to Michael in his prime, and that's unfair."" - Kobe Bryant (2003)",nba,"At 24, Kobe Bryant has three rings. At that age, Jordan had zero. At 24, Kobe has better all-around court sense, a better J and, unthinkably, even more madly creative mid-air Gumbyness than Jordan did. At 24, Kobe is hitting 38.5% of his treys; Jordan was shooting 18%. Over the last four weeks Kobe was on a mind-warping, pupil-popping, scorched-earth tear during which he scored 35 or more points in 13 straight games. Jordan hadn't done that at 24. Come to think of it, Jordan still hasn't done that.

""He's the best player in the game right now,"" Utah guard Mark Jackson said last week, after Kobe went for 40 points to help the Shaqless Lakers beat the Jazz. ""He's playing basketball that's as  
good as I've seen in my career."" Of course, Jackson's only been in the league for 16 years.

So why can't America embrace Kobe and his ozone-piercing potential? Why can't they realize that falling in love with Kobe doesn't mean breaking up with Michael? I mean, what's not to  
love?

Here's a young man who speaks fluent Italian, is married and has a child, and never shows up in the back of a squad car. Here's a pro who works out eight hours a day in the off-season, who one summer wouldn't go home until he'd made 1,000 jumpers a day. Here's a young god who's runway handsome, GQ cool and Eagle Scout nice.

In Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals in San Antonio last May, he blew up for 12 points in the fourth quarter to beat the Spurs. He was seconds from going live with NBC when he saw a  
small boy crying over the loss. He left the interviewer, went over and hugged the kid. Yet all anybody wants to do is line him up against Jordan and make sure he loses. Kobe's getting sick of  
it, and I don't blame him.

""People want to compare me with Michael in his prime,"" he says, ""and that's unfair. I don't think I'm in my prime yet. I think a player's prime is, like, 26 to 30. I'm only 24. But that's all they want to talk about. They're not saying, 'Kobe worked really hard at getting better at this.' Or, 'This is what I appreciate about Kobe.' It's always what I do in relation to Michael. Like, they say my competitiveness came from watching Michael. It never crossed their minds that I've been like this since I was five.""

Savor this kid. Wallow in his starshine. Be stupefied, mind-boggled, brain-bent. He's writing his legend right under our noses. Beats his man left-hand dribble, skies baseline and flushes over Yao Ming? Catches a long outlet, goes behind his back to lose a Denver Nugget and 360 slams? Driving the baseline, takes off outside the paint, loses Latrell Sprewell in midair and reverse dunks on the far side of the rim? And that's just in the last three weeks.

You want to argue? Bring it.

Jordan never had a Shaq. True, and Kobe never had a Hall of Fame swingman like Scottie Pippen. Or a rebound-munching forward as Dennis Rodman was in his prime. You think he wouldn't be handy to have around? Why, yes, Dennis, I would like to shoot again, thanks!

Jordan won 10 scoring titles. Kobe's got zilch. I watched Kobe score 56 in three quarters against Memphis last season--the man could win a scoring title wearing Muppet slippers. But many nights he has to put his ego in a jar to keep Shaq-Fu happy and well-fed with points. Plus, Kobe has the burden of handling the rock an awful lot--more than Jordan. ""I'm not saying it's harder,"" says Kobe, ""but it consumes a lot more energy, having those little guards crawling on you all the time. It's definitely more running.""

Kobe doesn't D-up like Jordan. True, but he's learning. He's increased his steals from 1.48 a game last season to 2.24 this season. He's averaging a career-best 7.0 rebounds, too. Jordan only beat that once. He's got the Bally's body at 24 that Jordan didn't build until he was 30.

I don't see six rings on Kobe's fingers. Let's say Kobe retires when Jordan will, at 40. That means he'd play 23 seasons. You think Kobe can't get four more rings in the next 16 seasons? ""Seven rings, eight rings, nine rings,"" Kobe says, ""I don't care. I just want to win. Every year.""

Yeah, well, the world will never love Kobe as much as Jordan. True, but maybe that's because Michael came first. If the order had been reversed, would Kobe have the IMAX movies, the jingles  
and the shoes? Would Michael be the one wearing Kobe's throwback at the All-Star Game?

They said nobody would ever punk Ruth's numbers. Then came Aaron.  
They said nobody would go lower than Nicklaus. Then came Tiger.  
Just roll the possibility around on your tongue for a second:  
Kobe Bryant could end up the greatest player in NBA history.

""Ooh,"" says Kobe, ""you just gave me goose bumps.""

The feeling is mutual.

At that age, Jordan had zero. At 24, Kobe has better all-around court sense, a better J and, unthinkably, even more madly creative mid-air Gumbyness than Jordan did. At 24, Kobe is hitting 38.5% of his treys; Jordan was shooting 18%. Over the last four weeks Kobe was on a mind-warping, pupil-popping, scorched-earth tear during which he scored 35 or more points in 13 straight games. Jordan hadn't done that at 24. Come to think of it, Jordan still hasn't done that.

""He's the best player in the game right now,"" Utah guard Mark Jackson said last week, after Kobe went for 40 points to help the Shaqless Lakers beat the Jazz. ""He's playing basketball that's as  
good as I've seen in my career."" Of course, Jackson's only been in the league for 16 years.

So why can't America embrace Kobe and his ozone-piercing potential? Why can't they realize that falling in love with Kobe doesn't mean breaking up with Michael? I mean, what's not to  
love?

Here's a young man who speaks fluent Italian, is married and has a child, and never shows up in the back of a squad car. Here's a pro who works out eight hours a day in the off-season, who one summer wouldn't go home until he'd made 1,000 jumpers a day. Here's a young god who's runway handsome, GQ cool and Eagle Scout nice.

In Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals in San Antonio last May, he blew up for 12 points in the fourth quarter to beat the Spurs. He was seconds from going live with NBC when he saw a  
small boy crying over the loss. He left the interviewer, went over and hugged the kid. Yet all anybody wants to do is line him up against Jordan and make sure he loses. Kobe's getting sick of  
it, and I don't blame him.

""People want to compare me with Michael in his prime,"" he says, ""and that's unfair. I don't think I'm in my prime yet. I think a player's prime is, like, 26 to 30. I'm only 24. But that's all they want to talk about. They're not saying, 'Kobe worked really hard at getting better at this.' Or, 'This is what I appreciate about Kobe.' It's always what I do in relation to Michael. Like, they say my competitiveness came from watching Michael. It never crossed their minds that I've been like this since I was five.""

Savor this kid. Wallow in his starshine. Be stupefied, mind-boggled, brain-bent. He's writing his legend right under our noses. Beats his man left-hand dribble, skies baseline and flushes over Yao Ming? Catches a long outlet, goes behind his back to lose a Denver Nugget and 360 slams? Driving the baseline, takes off outside the paint, loses Latrell Sprewell in midair and reverse dunks on the far side of the rim? And that's just in the last three weeks.

You want to argue? Bring it.

Jordan never had a Shaq. True, and Kobe never had a Hall of Fame swingman like Scottie Pippen. Or a rebound-munching forward as Dennis Rodman was in his prime. You think he wouldn't be handy to have around? Why, yes, Dennis, I would like to shoot again, thanks!

Jordan won 10 scoring titles. Kobe's got zilch. I watched Kobe score 56 in three quarters against Memphis last season--the man could win a scoring title wearing Muppet slippers. But many nights he has to put his ego in a jar to keep Shaq-Fu happy and well-fed with points. Plus, Kobe has the burden of handling the rock an awful lot--more than Jordan. ""I'm not saying it's harder,"" says Kobe, ""but it consumes a lot more energy, having those little guards crawling on you all the time. It's definitely more running.""

Kobe doesn't D-up like Jordan. True, but he's learning. He's increased his steals from 1.48 a game last season to 2.24 this season. He's averaging a career-best 7.0 rebounds, too. Jordan only beat that once. He's got the Bally's body at 24 that Jordan didn't build until he was 30.

"[Pompey] The problem that Daryl Morey faces is before you had Doc Rivers, who you could blame, you could blame “The Process,” you could blame other people. Right now, all eyes are on Morey ... if they don’t get out of the second round, he’s going to take the blame ... He could be the guy that goes.",nba,"&gt; Scotto: Daryl Morey has shown through his executive tenure with the Sixers and Rockets that he’s always been able to get star players. If Harden is traded, Morey could go all in on cap space for next summer and try to pair another star with Embiid and Maxey as the core going forward. As Morey looks to tinker with Philadelphia’s roster, he’s not an executive who’s gone through a rebuild, so I wonder how long he could stay with the Sixers depending on what happens with the Harden trade and potentially a transformative summer for the team in 2024.

&gt; Pompey: The rhetoric that’s coming out now is if they don’t get it done this year, they’ll have a lot of cap space next year. It sounds like that gives you an extra year to see if you can get things done.

The fact that he took over a Sixers team, and if they don’t get out of the second round, he’s going to take the blame and the brunt of it. He could be the guy that goes.

&gt; It’s one of those things where they blamed it on the coaching. People felt like the Sixers were a couple of adjustments away from getting out of the second round. Of course, everyone is going to look at the Harden situation. Morey is making a lot of money, and when he came in here, the Sixers were supposed to ascend. When Brett Brown was the coach, it was the second round. When Elton Brand was leading the front office, it was the second round. Now, you’ve got Morey and three max players or close to it in Harden, Embiid, and Tobias Harris, and it’s been three seasons in a row that they ended their season in the second round. I think Morey could be in trouble if they don’t get out of the second round.

Who is the best player to never get their jersey retired?,nba,"When teams who have few rings earn one, they often give props to nearly the entire starting line-up, and some times bench players. 

The Pistons, for example, have retired jerseys for Zeke, Dumars, Laimbeer, Rodman, and even Vinnie Johnson (poor Mark Aquirre). They've also retired Big Ben's number, and RIP's, and Chauncy's (poor Sheed and Prince). 

And even marquee names like Davie Bing and Bob Lanier got their numbers up. 

This goes across the board. Barkley has his number up in the rafters in Philly and Phoenix. 

But some important role players (like Kenny Smith, Sam Cassell, Mad Max, and Horry in Houston) don't get so much love, and even former All-Stars who won rings, like Otis Thorpe, don't get a jersey in the rafter (though Drexler did).

&amp;#x200B;

And some HOFers don't have a jersey retired at all.

The best one that comes to mind is McGrady. Splitting his time between so many teams and never seeing any playoff success certainly puts a dent in his options. 

But that got me thinking: Who is the BEST player to never get his jersey retired ANYWHERE? 

And to make it interesting, try putting together an All-Non-Jersey-Retired starting line-up.

Hottest Thunder Take of the Summer,nba,"I don't see a lot of differences in terms of talent at each role between the Thunder and the Grizzlies. The Thunder could be the second best team in the West next year. The Grizzlies were 2nd in the West by a solid margin over a scrappy Kings team.

Consider:


Shai = Morant


Chet/Dort = Adams/JJJ (most egregious error, I know, this is a hot take)


Jdub = Bane


Giddey = Smart




Now, maybe it's the defense that is lacking. But I see a lot of upside in continuity. Smart is a great defender, but the Celtics were kind of his team in a way. The defense was anchored on him. In Memphis, I think they have to figure it out. 


Also, on the group of talls and Dort: Chet will shoot and make as many  3's as JJJ. I think they will have similar blocks. I think JJJ is WAY BETTER than Chet as a rookie this year. However, Dort is a top tier guard-anyone player in the league.  With solid rim protection help coming from Chet, Dort is going to be even better. JJJ and Adams also protect the rim. All four players rebound their asses off. I think, for the purpose of this argument, it's a wash. Adams is a one-man offensive rebounding machine, and he contributes greatly to winning with screens. I doubt Chet will screen as effectively, as Adams, who is the best, but he will be serviceable for SGA as a pick-and-roll partner in a similar way to the Morant/Adams PNR.  

Giddey and Smart are both great playmakers. Where Giddey has a size advantage, Smart has a dribbling advantage. Similar 3-pt % for the two is my prediction. Smart probably shoots 2x the attempts. 


And  now for the best part: JDUB. This kid is a fucking all-time legend. The night man cometh. It was funny how at first   he was adjusting to NBA speed, and then he just hit a player improvement trajectory like a fucking rocket ship to outer space. I mean, he was taking over games. Straight up, Jdub can ball. I would never trade him for Bane, a max-contract player now, if you gave me 2 future firsts on top. Untouchable. Bane got that dog in him, but Jdub got the GOAT in him.

13.1 mpg is a pretty high number. Most teams each year have ~3-5 players who average less than 10 mpg; these players just get in at garbage time mostly.

The unique thing about that 09-10 Warriors team was just how truly decimated they were by injuries throughout that season (and their refusal to sign players to fill in). So, if you got in the game, you were usually going to play ~20 min. (or 48, if you judge by game 82 that year)

"[OC] How a basketball simulation engine ranks the best players of all time. AKA ""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!""",nba,"""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!"" Well, what if it was? 

The website WhatIfSports allows users to build their own virtual basketball teams from any season of any player in NBA/ABA history. Your virtual team will play simulated games against other teams, where every single possession of every single game is simulated for a new season of virtual basketball. **The engine uses real life results from players to simulate new possessions.** There are leagues of virtual teams that play 82 simulated games plus playoffs. As an avid WIS player, looking at all players' stats under a microscope has given me an interesting perspective. 

I have been playing on WiS for close to 10 years, and have decided to share some of what I learned here. **I do not believe that this is the actual all-time rankings of these players.** But this is roughly how players (or rather the results of players' regular season stats) look to the eyes of a simulation engine. ***This is who The SIM thinks the greatest players of all time are.***

###Identifying the top players through a statistical lens. The best players: according to WhatIfSports' Simulation Engine.
_________________________________________
**The methodology:** 

There are lots of different game formats for WhatIfSports. Most of them involve a salary cap. We're not looking at data from those leagues; it would skew the data with an extra variable. Most formats also involve selecting the best season and only the best season of a player's career, which skews data towards players who peaked for one season; I also do not want this data, as it just looks at one year. So for this exercise, I will be looking at data from the ""Savage League""; which has no salary cap, and uses the 5 best seasons of a player's career (doesn't have to be consecutive)
&gt;**This allows us to identify the 5-best statistical years of players' careers.** So not quite ""best careers"", and not quite ""best peaks"" (since the 5 seasons don't have to be consecutive), but somewhere in-between. 


The Savage League is a draft league that has each of 24 users draft 12 players (288 total NBA/ABA players) and then assemble 5 unique teams that each contain one unique season of each of your 12 players. So if you draft Michael Jordan, you pick 5 of his seasons and put one on each of your 5 teams, and repeat for your other 11 players (with a lot more strategy involved that I don't need to get into.) and pit your 5 teams against 23 GMs who each have 5 teams. You set your lineups and set some basic strategy, and then the website will simulate matchups over the course of 82 games + playoffs against other users. Every season of every player in NBA history is eligible to be drafted, and trust me, we scour the obscure guys to find any advantage we can. 

I have participated in this league since it's inception, and I have lots of first hand knowledge, but I will mostly be relying on **ADP** (average draft position) plus the **results of the simulated teams** that had these players. So basically we will be working with a **modified ADP that bumps players up or down a bit based on how many wins the team that drafted them usually gets.** There is 11 seasons worth of data. 
____________________________________

Okay, let's look how this website/method is and isn't perfect. 

**What *isn't* a problem:**

- **Era-normalization:** This is not really a problem. We (the GMs) and the website (the ""Sim"") look at things in a *""per possession""* context. Usage rate, eFG%, foul draw rate, AST%, TO%, OREB%, DREB%, yada yada. All per-possession. So if Player A and Player B played in two separate eras with two vastly different paces, the stats will normalize that accordingly. 
&gt;Example: we don't care about how many rebounds a player grabbed per game. We don't even care how many rebounds a player grabbed per36; we care about what % of available rebounds that player was able to grab.
&gt;&gt;There is also a small adjustment made to all players' 2FG% and 3FG% based on the average effectiveness of the era, and the website even approximated 3PM of players who played pre-3pt era, as well as approximating blocks/steals/etc for eras where that info wasn't tracked. It's not perfect, but it's not as big as a problem as you probably assumed it was, and I don't think there's a better solution out there. 

- **User/human biases:** I don't think this is a problem. We all pay $50 to play a season of Savage simply for bragging rights of winning the league, and the two worst finishers have to sit out the next time around. A user will rarely ever draft a player just because he/she likes them. We're all trying to make the best teams. Even if there is some human bias in selection, I am weighing the results by actual wins in the sim, and the sim has no bias. 
&gt;Example: I have drafted both Karl Malone and Miles Bridges even though I dislike both of them. It's all about winning, baby. 

- **Roster Fit/Chemistry:** This isn't a problem. You have to build teams to compliment your other players' strengths. This isn't like a fantasy basketball team where you just sum the raw ""points"" your players produced. You still need to have a good balance of passing/spacing/rebounding/defense/positional versatility/bench/etc etc on your team. The engine is simulating what it thinks would happen if your players were on the court at the same time against your opponent's players. 
&gt;Example: If you have Amare plus 3 good passers like Magic, Bird, and Draymond, then your Amare will probably score a higher FG% than he did in real life. If you put players who barely pass around Amare and make him create for himself, it would be lower. 
&gt;&gt;Even though Draymond Green, Ben Simmons, Rajon Rondo, Ben Wallace, and Dennis Rodman are all great players in this format, you can't game the system by putting them all on the same team. Everyone would pack the paint on D against you and you'd struggle to score.  

**What actually *is* a problem with this methodology:** 

- **Style of play is nearly-invisible to the stats:** The sim has no way of knowing that a player like Melo or Barkley would eat away the shotclock on ISOs. It just sees what % of possessions the player used, and what the results of those possessions were, and how the players around them might affect it. Unlike a video game, there's no physical attribute ""speed"", ""agility"", etc ratings.

- **Defensive ratings are imperfect:** While most of the numbers on a player's card are based on their actual real-life stats, there is one semi-arbitrary number: defense. The website assigns a 0-100 score for every player's defense, and there is some human error in this one component. All-D and DPOY awards boost this score. There's a lot of accuracy in some instances. But for some players, the ratings are inaccurate. 
&gt;Also, the website doesn't have a way to differentiate if a player is good at certain aspects of defense (on ISOs vs help, on perimeter vs paint, rotations, etc), just if they're good/average/bad at D overall, and how effective they are at guarding each position.

- **Teammate boosts:** DeAndre Jordan shot over 70% in 3 of his seasons that he played with Chris Paul. The website has no way to separate how good he would have been in a vacuum/without Chris Paul in those seasons. So DeAndre Jordan is a very very very good player in the Sim and we don't know how accurate that would be. It's not as big of a problem as you're imagining. He still only shoots roughly as often as he did irl, so he's still just a putback &amp; lob type of guy in the Sim. If you paired him with say Jordan Clarkson as his PG in the sim, his numbers would drop significantly, just like in real life. But it is a small issue. 

- **The Sim can't see invisible things** like well-set screens, boxing out, etc. This means that Brook Lopez is considered a bad rebounder in the sim. In real life, we know that he helps his team secure rebounds even though he doesn't grab them often himself. This could be solved if someone ever made a more complex sim that looked at on-floor/off-floor ratings too. It also doesn't factor in clutch rankings, mental toughness, etc. 

**Gray area problems** These are things that I don't think are a problem but someone might argue that they are:

- **Era-styles:** Up above I explained how everything is pace-normalized and how efficiency is era-adjusted. The one caveat to that is that 3-point attempt rates are going to stay what they were. In real life, Larry Bird never made more than 90 3s in a season. Some people might say ""if he played today, he'd attempt 600 per season!"" Well, he didn't. I think trying to make him shoot more 3s on-paper than he did irl would lead to more problems than it solves, but just putting this here for anyone who has this thought/question. 

- **Minutes:** Players can only play roughly the amount of minutes that they played in real life before they start to get ""fatigued"" or injured. You could argue that if a bench player was given more opportunity, they could play more minutes just fine. I could argue that if we took all of the elite low-MPG guys and could play them starter minutes without penalties, Boban would be a top 50 player. I think it's better the way that it is. 
________________________

**With that said, here are the highlights of the rankings:**

**1. LeBron James.** In this world, this isn't ever even a debate. He's #1 in this by a good margin. We've even discussed making his 6-10th best seasons a separate draftable player, and most people agree that version would be a top 5 pick if so. 

**2-6: Wilt Chamberlain, Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, Giannis, Kareem.** Roughly in that order. 

**7-9: Shaq, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul.** All three of these guys usually get drafted around here, and interestingly their teams all win about the same amount as each other on average. 

**10-18: David Robinson, Karl Malone, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Charles Barkley, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird.** Jokic is very divisive among us right now. His offensive stats are INSANE (I don't think the average NBA fan still understands how insane), but his defense is the worst out of every player you'd be considering in the first round. Gobert's numbers are phenomenal when looked at this way, and I think more of Utah's success from those years should be attributed to him by the average fan. Kawhi is the winningest player in this format and he keeps moving up. He used to be drafted around 28th but keeps winning and keeps getting drafted higher. A lot of his benefits are hard to notice at first glance. 

**19-24: Anthony Davis, DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan** For what it's worth, teams picking around here usually win more than those picking at the beginning (snake draft). These are all really good players in this format. 

**25-33: Julius Erving, Dwyane Wade, John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Ben Wallace, Scottie Pippen, Artis Gilmore, Moses Malone, Kevin McHale** Dr J has been quite successful lately, his teams have been winning a lot. 

From this point on I'll just drop in a few highlights: 

**Damian Lillard** has been going around 35th lately and has seen a lot of success on his teams at that selection, meaning he's going to start going even higher soon. He's very efficient. 

**Bill Russell** is about 40th. He has a great defensive rating and grabs a ton of boards (but not as many as he did irl due to pace-adjusting), but he is extremely inefficient at scoring, even with an era-adjusted boost. He's a decent passer, but when you look at it through the eyes of a per-possession lens, it's not nearly as impressive as his raw ""assist per game"" stats. For instance: in 64-65, he had 5.3 assists per game, but he also played 44.4 MPG at a really high possession pace. When you look at the same season at a per possession basis, he was getting assists at the same clip as 22-23 Jarred Vanderbilt.

**Shawn Marion** (~50th), **Bobby Jones** (~60th), **Horace Grant** (~65th), **Andrei Kirilenko** (~75th), **Sidney Moncrief** (~80th) are all examples of guys who don't get talked about enough in NBA circles who are really really freaking good. Go look up their BBallRef pages. They're all beasts in this format. I don't think it's a coincidence that all of them were on lots of winning teams in real life. 

**Manu** goes about 60th and **Tony Parker** rarely gets drafted, but will get drafted at about 240th if he does. Manu's per possession stats are insane.

**Dirk** goes around 150th usually. His scoring efficiency isn't as great as you'd think. His defense isn't great. His offensive rebounds are extremely low for a big man. He didn't shoot as many 3s as you imagine. He's a good, clean, player (great FTs, low TOs and fouls), but when you look at the numbers this way, he's several tiers below Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Charles Barkley, and Kevin Garnett. **Chris Webber** is about 200th. 

**Kobe** is about 60th. He's just far too inefficient to be a first or second rounder, but he can be a good pick in the 3rd round with the right team around him. (**Pau Gasol** is about 90th, **Bynum** is about 140th, and **Odom** is about 250th, for what it's worth)

**Oscar Robertson** goes around 40th. He's a lot more efficient than most guys from his era. His rebound and assist numbers are not nearly as impressive in a per-possession context though. 

**Russell Westbrook** is about 150th. He can single handedly tank your efficiency and TOs, but if you have the right pieces around him, he can be a contributor on a winning team. I'm not sure if the average fan understands truly how different his efficiency is vs someone like Steph. For context, Westbrook rebounds and assists at a much much higher rate than the Big O (when looked at per possession, not per game), but Oscar is still good at both while being a more efficient scorer who turns the ball over far less. 

**Walt Frazier** goes about 60th. **Willis Reed** is about 110th. 

**Grant Hill** usually gets drafted around 200th but is also the worst performer out of the entire field. His teams lose the most often. I think his eye test looks a lot better than his on-paper results. 

**Allen Iverson** is undraftable/unplayable. For a quick example, his 02-03 season has roughly the same usage as 22-23 SGA, but with 10% lower eFG, equal AST%, higher TO%, lower REB%, lower combined STL+BLK%, and lower FT% by 13%. The only thing he's better at than 22-23 SGA is that he fouls less. And SGA is only ranked about 180th in this environment. This isn't a human assigning a higher 2K rating to one player. These are his actual, real-life numbers. You could argue that his era was more inefficient, but AI actually has the lowest eFG% of all players with starter-minutes from that 02-03 season. So he was even extremely inefficient compared to his peers. Just an observation. 

**Paul George, Dikembe, Luka, Gary Payton, Embiid, Jason Kidd** are all around the same tier (~45th-55th) as either elite role players or good 2nd options on offense. If the fit is right, they can be your 2nd best player on a contender. If you get them in the 3rd, you're ecstatic. 

**Carmelo** is about 200th. He's okay as a bench player for a couple of seasons (in this context). His scoring wasn't as efficient as you'd imagine, and he wasn't good at anything else. 

**Drexler** and **Ewing** both go ~90th.

**Steve Nash** goes around 50th but his teams often perform poorly. His eFG, AST%, and TO% are all elite but man...he is a big fat negative on D and on boards. 

**Bill Walton** routinely goes around 50-60 even though he has extremely low minutes due to injury. He was that good when he did play. 

**Penny Hardaway** is about 75th all-time even though he can't contribute much due to injuries/low minutes outside of 1-2 seasons. He was also very good in the short time he was healthy. 

**Victor Oladipo** goes about 180th solely off the strength of that one good Indiana season (contributing nothing on the other 4 that you have to use him). Very strong season that stands up in a historical context. Nothing playable outside of that. 

**Brent Barry** and **Donyell Marshall** (not the washed-up version from the Cavs FYI) are both top-100 players in this format. I don't think many people understood advanced stats in that era, so people were sleeping on both of them. 

**Ben Simmons** is a top 90 player all-time in this context. Again, this can't account for him chickening out in crunch time, but I still think people forgot how good he was ~5 years ago. He is a very good player by advanced metrics. **KAT** is another example of this. He's a top-50 player of all time in this context. Again, the sim can't pick up on his ""softness"" or lack of star power in crunchtime, but I don't think people realize how good his scoring efficiency is historically (since most people look at FG%/traditional splits instead of eFG% or TS%)

Modern guys who rank higher than you'd imagine (remember, this is all-time): **Jrue Holiday** (~50), **Bam Adebayo** (~55), **Jimmy Buckets** (~55), **Draymond Green** (~65), **Al Horford** (~100), **Danny Green** (~100), **Michael Porter Jr** (~120), **Mike Conley** (~130), **Pascal Siakam** (~150). When you look at how often their teams win irl, it could be argued that they really do actually produce close to this value.

Random wing dump: **Luka** is about 50th. **Klay** is about 60th. **Gerald Wallace** is about 100th. **Ray Allen** is about 100th. **Jason Tatum** is about 120th. **Bradley Beal** is about 140th. **Paul Pierce** is about 150th. **Chris Mullin** is about 160th. **Reggie Miller** is about 200th. **T Mac** goes about 200th. **Vince Carter** goes about 200th but teams he gets drafted on have a high winning % so I think he should be top 150. 

Random PG dump: **Gary Payton** is about 50th. **Chauncey Billups** and **Deron Williams** are both about 90th. **Lowry** is about 100th. **Mark Price** goes at about 130. **Lonzo** actually goes higher (~140th) than **LaMelo** (~200th) usually. **Jose Calderon** goes about 160th, his efficiency was crazy. 

Random big dump (maybe there's a better phrase?): **Shawn Kemp** ~55th. **Ibaka** ~70th. **Jonas V** actually goes ~80th. **Amare** ~100th. **K Love** ~120. **Carlos Boozer** ~140

**Zion** goes top 200 every single time, even though he BARELY has minutes. He's that good in the few minutes he does play.  

**Tyrese Haliburton** goes ~100th in this format even though he can only contribute for 2/5 seasons and even though he hasn't hit his prime yet. He's going to be a top 40 player on this list someday. Maybe higher. **Walker Kessler** is already a stud in this format as well. 

Players in the real-life NBA top-75 who wouldn't even sniff the top-250 of this format (alphabetical by last name): **Nate Archibald, Paul Arizin, Rick Barry, Elgin Baylor, Dave Bing, Bob Cousy, Dave DeBusschere, Hal Greer, Elvin Hayes, Allen Iverson, Sam Jones, Pete Maravich, George Mikan, Earl Monroe, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Bill Sharman, Isiah Thomas, Nate Thurmond, Lenny Wilkens, Dominique Wilkins.**

Surprise guys who do make the list (all of these guys routinely get drafted, but usually not in the top 200. But all are better than some NBA Top-75 team guys in this format): **Kirk Hinrich, Patrick Beverley, Marvin Williams, Fat Lever, Gary Payton II, Charlie Ward, Joe Ingles, Taj Gibson, James Johnson, Nate McMillan, Nic Batum, Eddie Jones, Nic Claxton**

Guys who rarely get talked about on /r/NBA who are relevant in our sim-world: **Larry Nance Sr** (~60th), **Buck Williams** (~75), **Chris Boucher** (~120), **Delon Wright** (~150), **Jamario Moon** (~160), **Daniel Gafford** (~160), **Kyle O' Quinn** (~160), **Hot Rod Williams** (~200), **Tom Boerwinkle** (~200), **Bill Bridges** (~200), **Clarence Weatherspoon** (~240), **Don Buse** (~240), **Larry Sanders** (~240), **Dana Barros** (240), **Bobby Phills** (240) - most of these are elite role players. If we have our usage covered, we're looking for someone who can contribute without taking up any possessions. 

Conclusions: Obviously this isn't perfect. I am in no way saying that this is actually what these players' all-time rankings are/should be. However, I am saying we can learn something from it. Dwight is a top-10 player all-time by the numbers when you neutralize eras with per-possesion stats, and combined with his awards and accolades, I do think he absolutely should have made the top-75 team. 

I do think that we miss a lot of things with the eye-test. You probably think Ben Wallace (~35th) and Bam Adebayo (~55) are way too high on this list, and they probably are. I would also argue that we usually have them too low on our human-made lists. Look at their real-life successes. With players like these, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle of the two. Adebayo was the 1B on 2 teams that went to the finals. I do think we should consider him a lot better than we do. Not 55th best of all time good. But he's probably a more impactful player than most people realize. Similarly, while I do think that Westbrook and A.I. are top-100 players of all-time, I do think they're a little overrated. The stats back that up. 

If you are thinking ""well how can ___ be so low if his team won X games/made the finals in real life"", I will tell you that the SIM would probably come up with similar results often for most historical matchups of that player's team vs his competition, but that you're probably undervaluing certain players on those teams and overvaluing others. Again, it's not perfect and doesn't 100% reflect reality, but I think guys like Ben Wallace and Dikembe Mutombo were more valuable in the 00s than most realize. 

Anyway, if you're a big old nerd, come join us. Feel free to message me if you want to build some virtual teams as a GM and want tips/advice. There are even formats where you can draft and trade every offseason. I don't work for them or anything. Just bored and it's the offseason.",t5_2qo4s,22081,3763,"[OC] How a basketball simulation engine ranks the best players of all time. AKA ""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!""""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!"" Well, what if it was?

I could argue that if we took all of the elite low-MPG guys and could play them starter minutes without penalties, Boban would be a top 50 player. I think it's better the way that it is. 
________________________

**With that said, here are the highlights of the rankings:**

**1. LeBron James.** In this world, this isn't ever even a debate. He's #1 in this by a good margin. We've even discussed making his 6-10th best seasons a separate draftable player, and most people agree that version would be a top 5 pick if so. 

**2-6: Wilt Chamberlain, Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, Giannis, Kareem.** Roughly in that order. 

**7-9: Shaq, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul.** All three of these guys usually get drafted around here, and interestingly their teams all win about the same amount as each other on average. 

**10-18: David Robinson, Karl Malone, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Charles Barkley, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird.** Jokic is very divisive among us right now. His offensive stats are INSANE (I don't think the average NBA fan still understands how insane), but his defense is the worst out of every player you'd be considering in the first round. Gobert's numbers are phenomenal when looked at this way, and I think more of Utah's success from those years should be attributed to him by the average fan. Kawhi is the winningest player in this format and he keeps moving up. He used to be drafted around 28th but keeps winning and keeps getting drafted higher. A lot of his benefits are hard to notice at first glance. 

**19-24: Anthony Davis, DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan** For what it's worth, teams picking around here usually win more than those picking at the beginning (snake draft). These are all really good players in this format. 

**25-33: Julius Erving, Dwyane Wade, John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Ben Wallace, Scottie Pippen, Artis Gilmore, Moses Malone, Kevin McHale** Dr J has been quite successful lately, his teams have been winning a lot. 

From this point on I'll just drop in a few highlights: 

**Damian Lillard** has been going around 35th lately and has seen a lot of success on his teams at that selection, meaning he's going to start going even higher soon. He's very efficient. 

**Bill Russell** is about 40th. He has a great defensive rating and grabs a ton of boards (but not as many as he did irl due to pace-adjusting), but he is extremely inefficient at scoring, even with an era-adjusted boost. He's a decent passer, but when you look at it through the eyes of a per-possession lens, it's not nearly as impressive as his raw ""assist per game"" stats. For instance: in 64-65, he had 5.3 assists per game, but he also played 44.4 MPG at a really high possession pace. When you look at the same season at a per possession basis, he was getting assists at the same clip as 22-23 Jarred Vanderbilt.

**Shawn Marion** (~50th), **Bobby Jones** (~60th), **Horace Grant** (~65th), **Andrei Kirilenko** (~75th), **Sidney Moncrief** (~80th) are all examples of guys who don't get talked about enough in NBA circles who are really really freaking good. Go look up their BBallRef pages. They're all beasts in this format. I don't think it's a coincidence that all of them were on lots of winning teams in real life. 

**Manu** goes about 60th and **Tony Parker** rarely gets drafted, but will get drafted at about 240th if he does. Manu's per possession stats are insane.

**Dirk** goes around 150th usually. His scoring efficiency isn't as great as you'd think. His defense isn't great. His offensive rebounds are extremely low for a big man. He didn't shoot as many 3s as you imagine. He's a good, clean, player (great FTs, low TOs and fouls), but when you look at the numbers this way, he's several tiers below Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Charles Barkley, and Kevin Garnett. **Chris Webber** is about 200th. 

**Kobe** is about 60th. He's just far too inefficient to be a first or second rounder, but he can be a good pick in the 3rd round with the right team around him. (**Pau Gasol** is about 90th, **Bynum** is about 140th, and **Odom** is about 250th, for what it's worth)

**Oscar Robertson** goes around 40th. He's a lot more efficient than most guys from his era. His rebound and assist numbers are not nearly as impressive in a per-possession context though. 

**Russell Westbrook** is about 150th. He can single handedly tank your efficiency and TOs, but if you have the right pieces around him, he can be a contributor on a winning team. I'm not sure if the average fan understands truly how different his efficiency is vs someone like Steph. For context, Westbrook rebounds and assists at a much much higher rate than the Big O (when looked at per possession, not per game), but Oscar is still good at both while being a more efficient scorer who turns the ball over far less. 

**Walt Frazier** goes about 60th. **Willis Reed** is about 110th. 

**Grant Hill** usually gets drafted around 200th but is also the worst performer out of the entire field. His teams lose the most often. I think his eye test looks a lot better than his on-paper results. 

**Allen Iverson** is undraftable/unplayable. For a quick example, his 02-03 season has roughly the same usage as 22-23 SGA, but with 10% lower eFG, equal AST%, higher TO%, lower REB%, lower combined STL+BLK%, and lower FT% by 13%. The only thing he's better at than 22-23 SGA is that he fouls less. And SGA is only ranked about 180th in this environment. This isn't a human assigning a higher 2K rating to one player. These are his actual, real-life numbers. You could argue that his era was more inefficient, but AI actually has the lowest eFG% of all players with starter-minutes from that 02-03 season. So he was even extremely inefficient compared to his peers. Just an observation. 

**Paul George, Dikembe, Luka, Gary Payton, Embiid, Jason Kidd** are all around the same tier (~45th-55th) as either elite role players or good 2nd options on offense. If the fit is right, they can be your 2nd best player on a contender. If you get them in the 3rd, you're ecstatic. 

**Carmelo** is about 200th. He's okay as a bench player for a couple of seasons (in this context). His scoring wasn't as efficient as you'd imagine, and he wasn't good at anything else. 

**Drexler** and **Ewing** both go ~90th.

**Steve Nash** goes around 50th but his teams often perform poorly. His eFG, AST%, and TO% are all elite but man...he is a big fat negative on D and on boards. 

**Bill Walton** routinely goes around 50-60 even though he has extremely low minutes due to injury. He was that good when he did play. 

**Penny Hardaway** is about 75th all-time even though he can't contribute much due to injuries/low minutes outside of 1-2 seasons. He was also very good in the short time he was healthy. 

**Victor Oladipo** goes about 180th solely off the strength of that one good Indiana season (contributing nothing on the other 4 that you have to use him). Very strong season that stands up in a historical context. Nothing playable outside of that. 

**Brent Barry** and **Donyell Marshall** (not the washed-up version from the Cavs FYI) are both top-100 players in this format. I don't think many people understood advanced stats in that era, so people were sleeping on both of them. 

**Ben Simmons** is a top 90 player all-time in this context. Again, this can't account for him chickening out in crunch time, but I still think people forgot how good he was ~5 years ago. He is a very good player by advanced metrics. **KAT** is another example of this. He's a top-50 player of all time in this context. Again, the sim can't pick up on his ""softness"" or lack of star power in crunchtime, but I don't think people realize how good his scoring efficiency is historically (since most people look at FG%/traditional splits instead of eFG% or TS%)

Modern guys who rank higher than you'd imagine (remember, this is all-time): **Jrue Holiday** (~50), **Bam Adebayo** (~55), **Jimmy Buckets** (~55), **Draymond Green** (~65), **Al Horford** (~100), **Danny Green** (~100), **Michael Porter Jr** (~120), **Mike Conley** (~130), **Pascal Siakam** (~150). When you look at how often their teams win irl, it could be argued that they really do actually produce close to this value.

Random wing dump: **Luka** is about 50th. **Klay** is about 60th. **Gerald Wallace** is about 100th. **Ray Allen** is about 100th. **Jason Tatum** is about 120th. **Bradley Beal** is about 140th. **Paul Pierce** is about 150th. **Chris Mullin** is about 160th. **Reggie Miller** is about 200th. **T Mac** goes about 200th. **Vince Carter** goes about 200th but teams he gets drafted on have a high winning % so I think he should be top 150. 

Random PG dump: **Gary Payton** is about 50th. **Chauncey Billups** and **Deron Williams** are both about 90th. **Lowry** is about 100th. **Mark Price** goes at about 130. **Lonzo** actually goes higher (~140th) than **LaMelo** (~200th) usually. **Jose Calderon** goes about 160th, his efficiency was crazy. 

Random big dump (maybe there's a better phrase?): **Shawn Kemp** ~55th. **Ibaka** ~70th. **Jonas V** actually goes ~80th. **Amare** ~100th. **K Love** ~120. **Carlos Boozer** ~140

**Zion** goes top 200 every single time, even though he BARELY has minutes. He's that good in the few minutes he does play.  

**Tyrese Haliburton** goes ~100th in this format even though he can only contribute for 2/5 seasons and even though he hasn't hit his prime yet. He's going to be a top 40 player on this list someday. Maybe higher. **Walker Kessler** is already a stud in this format as well. 

Players in the real-life NBA top-75 who wouldn't even sniff the top-250 of this format (alphabetical by last name): **Nate Archibald, Paul Arizin, Rick Barry, Elgin Baylor, Dave Bing, Bob Cousy, Dave DeBusschere, Hal Greer, Elvin Hayes, Allen Iverson, Sam Jones, Pete Maravich, George Mikan, Earl Monroe, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Bill Sharman, Isiah Thomas, Nate Thurmond, Lenny Wilkens, Dominique Wilkins.**

Surprise guys who do make the list (all of these guys routinely get drafted, but usually not in the top 200. But all are better than some NBA Top-75 team guys in this format): **Kirk Hinrich, Patrick Beverley, Marvin Williams, Fat Lever, Gary Payton II, Charlie Ward, Joe Ingles, Taj Gibson, James Johnson, Nate McMillan, Nic Batum, Eddie Jones, Nic Claxton**

Guys who rarely get talked about on /r/NBA who are relevant in our sim-world: **Larry Nance Sr** (~60th), **Buck Williams** (~75), **Chris Boucher** (~120), **Delon Wright** (~150), **Jamario Moon** (~160), **Daniel Gafford** (~160), **Kyle O' Quinn** (~160), **Hot Rod Williams** (~200), **Tom Boerwinkle** (~200), **Bill Bridges** (~200), **Clarence Weatherspoon** (~240), **Don Buse** (~240), **Larry Sanders** (~240), **Dana Barros** (240), **Bobby Phills** (240) - most of these are elite role players. If we have our usage covered, we're looking for someone who can contribute without taking up any possessions. 

Conclusions: Obviously this isn't perfect. I am in no way saying that this is actually what these players' all-time rankings are/should be. However, I am saying we can learn something from it. Dwight is a top-10 player all-time by the numbers when you neutralize eras with per-possesion stats, and combined with his awards and accolades, I do think he absolutely should have made the top-75 team. 

I do think that we miss a lot of things with the eye-test. You probably think Ben Wallace (~35th) and Bam Adebayo (~55) are way too high on this list, and they probably are. I would also argue that we usually have them too low on our human-made lists. Look at their real-life successes. With players like these, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle of the two. Adebayo was the 1B on 2 teams that went to the finals. I do think we should consider him a lot better than we do. Not 55th best of all time good. But he's probably a more impactful player than most people realize. Similarly, while I do think that Westbrook and A.I. are top-100 players of all-time, I do think they're a little overrated. The stats back that up. 

If you are thinking ""well how can ___ be so low if his team won X games/made the finals in real life"", I will tell you that the SIM would probably come up with similar results often for most historical matchups of that player's team vs his competition, but that you're probably undervaluing certain players on those teams and overvaluing others. Again, it's not perfect and doesn't 100% reflect reality, but I think guys like Ben Wallace and Dikembe Mutombo were more valuable in the 00s than most realize. 

Anyway, if you're a big old nerd, come join us. Feel free to message me if you want to build some virtual teams as a GM and want tips/advice. There are even formats where you can draft and trade every offseason. I don't work for them or anything. Just bored and it's the offseason."

Goat debate in Basketball,nba,"Non NBA fan, I have no clue about basket ball but I watch Football or Soccer.

In soccer there’s a debate between Messi and Ronaldo. Comparing both players through stats, Trophies and eye test will show that there’s a clear winner however there is still of course a debate. 

Now here’s my question, is the debate the same for basketball? What I mean is that one player is obviously better than the other but the debate exists because people can’t look past someone they idolise or is the NBA GOAT discussion more intelligent and nuanced?

Why are people constantly overestimating the value of the Dejounte Murray trade?,nba,"Bit of a rant from a peeved Hawks fan.

There is a thread that is getting a lot of responses talking about which team is in the worst position in the league. One of the names which was brought up was the Hawks, in which many people talked about the value given up for DJM (all star tier player) had handicapped their future

This has also been a common occurrence in which people compare this trade with the Gobert trade which is...nuts.

I don't know if it's because ATL is not a popular team, or because people confuse the two because they happened close to eachother, but  can we look at some facts here?

What the Hawks gave up:
 
2025 and 2027 1st
2026 Swap
2023 1st (from NY)
Danillo Gallinari 

Ok, let's break this down: The two unprotected picks are the big value pieces here. 2025 and 2027 will likely be years into both Trae and DJ's prime years, so if everything goes well they won't be worth much. But NBA teams are always on the lookout for implosion. So that's value.

2026 swap - theoretically, what is the value here? Given the timeline of Wemby and Trae, you could say either that both teams will be around the same level (Trae + some help has proven to be a baseline of atleast 40 wins and a playoff berth the last 3 years), or you could argue that the Hawks would be better. But I'm not seeing the scenario where the Hawks are demonstrably worse to the point that this matters.

2023 1st - A pick the Hawks got from NY for Cam Reddish. Not their own pick at all. A straight up bonus which saved them from trading one down the line. A great piece to include in the deal, actually. Really hurt them I bet.

Gallo - Salary filler out of the league.

All in all, the Hawks essentially gave up 2 firsts for an all-star level player. Really emptied the clip, huh?

They kept both their 2023 and 2024 picks as well, one of which was just  used on Kobe Bufkin. 


Maybe I'm biased due to being a Hawks homer. But can someone explain what the big overwhelming cost of this deal was? Oh, and the Hawks just signed DJM to one of the best contracts in the NBA and locked him in until the end of the pick exchanges if he's not traded.

Really killed the franchise guys. Brush up and do your homework please.",t5_2qo4s,2214,409,"Why are people constantly overestimating the value of the Dejounte Murray trade?Bit of a rant from a peeved Hawks fan.

There is a thread that is getting a lot of responses talking about which team is in the worst position in the league. One of the names which was brought up was the Hawks, in which many people talked about the value given up for DJM (all star tier player) had handicapped their future

This has also been a common occurrence in which people compare this trade with the Gobert trade which is...nuts.

I don't know if it's because ATL is not a popular team, or because people confuse the two because they happened close to eachother, but  can we look at some facts here?

What the Hawks gave up:
 
2025 and 2027 1st
2026 Swap
2023 1st (from NY)
Danillo Gallinari 

Ok, let's break this down: The two unprotected picks are the big value pieces here. 2025 and 2027 will likely be years into both Trae and DJ's prime years, so if everything goes well they won't be worth much. But NBA teams are always on the lookout for implosion. So that's value.

We're going to hit the 100-mark for scores with this batch of players, and I feel like that's when someone can really start making a case for a player as a Hall of Famer. It might not be a *good* case, but there is at least *a* case to be made. I don't think I've said this yet, but for reference points on scores: everyone who has a score over 250 and is eligible for the Hall of Fame is in the Hall of Fame (49 total players). There are 23 players who score between 200 and 250, and 22 of them have been inducted (95.7%). There are 36 players who score between 150 and 200, and 29 of them have been inducted (80.6%). The drop-off for inductees happens fast after that, with 53 players scoring between 100 and 150, with 26 being inducted (49.0%).

There's two ways to look at that. The first is that, since this is scored out of 1000, if a player accomplishes roughly 10-15% of what the greatest players to ever live have done, the have about a 50/50 chance of making it into the Hall of Fame. So, it makes it seem like the Hall of Fame is super easy to get into.

The other way to look at it, is that the guys at the top are so far ahead of everyone else that it's just hard to really comprehend. Oscar Robertson has a score in the 500s. If a player as exceptional as Oscar Robertson only accomplished about half as much as the very, very best of the sport, it should tell you how insanely good the very top tier of this actually is.

Something to think about while you check out today's list of names.

&amp;#x200B;

* **205. Dick McGuire - 97.0**
   * Career - 79.4
      * 1950-1960
      * NYK, DET
      * 50.9 Win Shares
      * 0.010 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 1x All-NBA Second Team Selection (1951)
      * 7x All-Star Selection (1951, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959)
      * 2.4 Finals Win Shares (3 Finals losses - 1951 NYK, 1952 NYK, 1953 NYK)
      * 0.8 Conference Finals Win Shares (1 Conf. Finals loss - 1958 DET)
   * Peak - 114.7
      * 1951-1955
   * Other achievements
      * College Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee (2006)
      * \#15 retired by the New York Knicks
   * McGuire is the only ""old-timey"" Knick to get his jersey retired. And I know most people reading this will say, ""every Knick with their jersey retired is 'old-timey'"" but I mean, *really* ""old-timey,"" like, pre-1970s title teams old-timey. McGuire led the team to three straight Finals in the early 1950s, losing to the Rochester Royals and a bunch of players I guarantee you've never heard of in 1951 (the Kings' only title!) and George Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers the next two years.
   * As of now, Dick and Al McGuire are the only pair of brothers inducted in the Hall of Fame (Dick as a player, Al as a coach.) Reggie and Cheryl Miller are also in there as siblings. (Also, this is totally unrelated, but did you know Reggie and Cheryl have another brother named Darrell who played baseball for the Angels for three seasons? Never gets mentioned.)
   * McGuire also has one of the rare ""double jersey number retirements,"" where the same jersey is retired for two different people. His jersey was retired in 1992 to go alongside Earl Monroe's, which was retired in 1986. Not counting any of the double 6's, the Blazers are the only other team to do this so far, retiring #30 for Terry Porter and Bob Gross, both in 2008.

&amp;#x200B;

* 204. Paul Seymour - 97.4
   * Career - 64.9
      * 1948, 1950-1960
      * BLB, SYR
      * 37.5 Win Shares
      * 2x All-NBA Second Team Selection (1954, 1955)
      * 3x All-Star Selection (1953, 1954, 1955)
      * 0.5 Championship Win Shares (1 title - 1955 SYR)
      * 2.0 Finals Win Shares (2 Finals losses - 1950 SYR, 1954 SYR)
      * 0.3 Conference Finals Win Shares (4 Conf. Finals losses - 1951 SYR, 1952 SYR, 1956 SYR, 1957 SYR)
   * Peak - 130.5
      * 1952-1956
   * Seymour is a perfect example of why the way the NBA keeps track of its own stats and history doesn't make sense. In 1948, Seymour played for the Baltimore Bullets of the BAA. So far, so good. In 1949, he played for the Syracuse Nationals, a team you may have heard of as they became the Philadelphia 76ers. However, in 1949, the Nationals were in the NBL, so, that season's stats/accomplishments don't count toward Seymour's totals (despite the fact that we do have at least some of those numbers.) The next year, 1950, the BAA and NBL merged to create the NBA. So, Seymour is all good again, as the Nationals are now part of the NBA.
   * So we end up with two leagues, both theoretically on equal footing (the NBL was larger and had more history, but the BAA had the East Coast), merging to form the NBA. Yet only the BAA history as counted as ""official"" by the NBA today. The Lakers and Warriors each count one of their titles from these BAA days. (If we counted the NBL titles, most of the winning teams are defunct, but the Pistons would have two more, the Kings one more, and the Lakers one more.)
   * (Just for fun, the Pistons, Lakers, Kings, Sixers, and Hawks are the surviving NBL teams today.)
   * There was a lot of backroom politicking done in the 1940s and 1950s, as to why this happened the way it did, which I won't go into here because it's long and complicated. But why we're still going along with this charade this many years later is beyond me. Either say the NBA started in 1950 (when it did, when the merger happened to form the brand-new league), or take *both* the BAA and NBL stats from before the merger and count them as legitimate. We still have time to celebrate the NBA's proper 75th anniversary in 2025!

&amp;#x200B;

* 203. Larry Nance - 97.9
   * Career - 97.9
      * 1982-1994
      * PHO, CLE
      * 109.6 Win Shares
      * 0.004 Adjusted MVP Award Shares
      * 3x All-Star Selection (1985, 1989, 1993)
      * 1x All-Defensive First Team Selection (1989)
      * 4.1 Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1984 PHO, 1992 CLE)
   * Peak - 85.7
      * 1989-1993
   * Other achievements
      * 2x All-Defensive Second Team Selection (1992, 1993)
      * \#22 retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers
   * Nance gets hurt a bit in the ""peak"" portion of this because his All-Star selections are so spread out. He's one of the very few players who has 3+ selections, but they're not within a five-year timeframe. I wish I could give him bonus points just for being cool, but, alas.

&amp;#x200B;

* *202. Khris Middleton - 98.0*
   * Career - 71.5
      * 2013-2023
      * DET, MIL
      * 52.5 Win Shares
      * 3x All-Star Selection (2019, 2020, 2022)
      * 2.2 Championship Win Shares (1 title - 2021 MIL)
      * 1.5 Conference Finals Win Shares (1 Conf. Finals loss - 2019 MIL)
   * Peak - 124.6
      * 2018-2022
   * Other achievements
      * Olympic Gold Medalist (2020)
   * If Middleton does nothing else in his entire career, I feel like he's the perfect example of a ""not-quite-a-Hall-of-Famer."" Three All-Star Selections, one championship as the second-best player, one Olympic Gold Medal. That's really good! I don't think we can put it in the Hall of Fame, but that's really, really good!

&amp;#x200B;

* **201. Roger Brown -98.4**
   * Career - 68.6
      * 1968-1975 (ABA)
      * INA, MMS, UTS, INA
      * 65.2 ABA Win Shares
      * 0.570 Adjusted ABA MVP Award Shares (1 top five finish: 1970 - 4th)
      * 1x All-ABA First Team Selection (1971)
      * 2x All-ABA Second Team Selection (1968, 1970)
      * 4x ABA All-Star Selection (1968, 1970, 1971, 1972)
      * 8.2 ABA Championship Win Shares (3 titles - 1970 INA, 1972 INA, 1973 INA)
      * 3.9 ABA Finals Win Shares (2 Finals losses - 1969 INA, 1975 INA)
      * 2.9 ABA Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1971 INA, 1974 INA)
      * 1x ABA Playoff MVP (1970)
   * Peak - 128.2
      * 1970-1974
   * Other achievements
      * \#35 retired by the Indiana Pacers
   * Brown is the main reason I wanted to include ABA players when I did this. (Also partially Mel Daniels, also partially the first third of Dr. J's career.) He's easily the best player from the ABA to never play in the NBA. You could argue Daniels, but he did end up playing 11 games for the Nets after the merger with minimal impact.
   * Brown was banned by the NBA, as well as the NCAA, (in the same scheme that caught up Connie Hawkins) for point shaving in high school. And it's very unclear to me how much he would have actually been guilty of anything. Much like Hawkins, it seems like Brown's only crime was associating with Jack Molinas (long story short, [the guy was basically a mobster involved in all kinds of illegal things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Molinas#Match_fixing) who had previously played in the NBA). It's not like he *couldn't* have made it in the NBA, he just didn't have the option.
   * He was reinstated by the NBA after the league's merged, but he chose to not play for the NBA, either because he was older (he would've been 34 for the 1977 season) or because he was still pissed about the ban (understandable) or a combination of the two.
   * Anyway, the whole complication of figuring out ABA to NBA relative strength equations and everything is because Jack Molinas was a dick, and the NBA was terrified of even a whiff of scandal.

&amp;#x200B;

* 200. Eddie Jones - 98.6
   * Career - 90.6
      * 1995-2008
      * LAL, CHH, MIA, MEM, MIA, DAL
      * 100.6 Win Shares
      * 1x All-NBA Third Team Selection (2000)
      * 3x All-Star Selection (1997, 1998, 2000)
      * 3.6 Conference Finals Win Shares (2 Conf. Finals losses - 1998 LAL, 2005 MIA)
   * Peak - 106.6
      * 1997-2001
   * Other achievements
      * Atlantic 10 Player of the Year (1994)
      * 3x All-Defensive Second Team Selection (1998, 1999, 2000)
   * Sometimes I wonder if the Lakers would have three-peated if they had just kept Jones and Nick Van Exel from the 1998 team. That year, the Lakers went 61-21 and lost in the Conference Finals to the Jazz. (Yes, we were *this close* to having Kobe and Jordan in the same NBA Finals. But the Bulls playing a dominant center in Shaq would've been fascinating to watch.) Shaq, Kobe, Jones, and Van Exel all made the All-Star Game that season as well, though Kobe was voted in and wouldn't have been selected without the fan vote. Anyway, the Lakers ended up trading Jones to Charlotte for Glen Rice and Van Exel to Denver for nothing, and signed a few other guys in the intervening year, but the core was still all there: Shaq, Kobe, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Robert Horry... It would have been interesting to say the least. (Van Exel was reportedly traded because he didn't like the coach at the time, Del Harris, and those Lakers had a *lot* of guards, but still.)
   * Jones also started his Lakers career wearing #25, which the Lakers retired for Gail Goodrich when he made the Hall of Fame in 1996. I have yet to find a good source on whether Jones switched to #6 of his own volition, or if it was ""strongly suggested"" to him that he change it, but the fact that he kept it the rest of his career seems like he must have been cool with it.

&amp;#x200B;

* 199. Bob Feerick - 98.7
   * Career - 62.2
      * 1947-1950
      * WSC
      * 41.7 Win Shares
      * 2x All-BAA First Team Selection (1947, 1948)
      * 1x All-BAA Second Team Selection (1949)
      * 0.1 Finals Win Shares (1 Finals loss - 1949 WSC)
      * 1.1 Conference Finals Win Shares (1 Conf. Finals loss - 1947 WSC)
   * Peak - 135.1
      * 1947-1950
   * Feerick was a finalist for the very first ""NBA Anniversary Team"" in 1971.  (He didn't make it but I don't have a lot else to say about him, so I'm going to go into this here.) This would have been the 25th Anniversary Team, where the NBA was still really trying to push the BAA founding as it's first season because the BAA guys were still around and wanted their narrative at the top. Anyway, that's why the numbering is messed up now because the 50th Anniversary Team and 75th Anniversary Team would've looked weird if they *weren't* in 1996 and then 2021, respectively.
   * The 25th Anniversary Team was done differently than either the 50th or 75th. Instead of naming the top 25 players of the first 25 years, they just did an analogue of the All-NBA team and named a First and Second Team, with active players being ineligible. Here are the results: First Team - Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman, Bill Russell, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes. Second Team - Bob Davies, Sam Jones, Paul Arizin, Joe Fulks, George Mikan.
   * Feerick and Max Zaslofsky are the only players who were [finalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_25th_Anniversary_Team#Nominees) for that team not currently in the Hall of Fame.

   * The way I keep track of postseason win shares is I take whatever win shares the player accumulated in the postseason, then just slot them into how far his team made it during the postseason (Championship, Finals, or Conference Finals). Porter has the third most Finals Win Shares of any player who never won a title. Elgin Baylor (10.6) and Jimmy Butler (6.9) are the only players ahead of him.
   * He's actually 12th all-time in Finals Win Shares, which is kind of wild, especially since he did that in only two postseasons. The top of that list is: Jerry West, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, Wes Unseld, Shaquille O'Neal, and Jimmy Butler. Not too bad of company, honestly.

   * Love started his career in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, sometimes just shortened to EBL, after failing to make the Cincinnati Royals roster in 1966. This was the league that was once known as the Eastern Pennsylvania Basketball League, founded in 1946, and would later change it's name to the Continental Basketball Association, which ran until 2009. 
   * If you were a kid growing up in the 90s, the CBA was no doubt described to you as ""minor league basketball"" at one point or another. This was sort of true in the 80s and 90s, though there was never any sort of official arrangement between the leagues, it was just a *de facto* state of affairs.
   * Also, if you want to look into some seriously shady stuff, Isiah Thomas bought the league (the whole damn league, every single team) in 1999. The NBA then offered to buy the league from Thomas in 2000, who said no. The NBA then announces it's going to create its own minor league (which became the Developmental League, and later the G-League). Thomas is then offered a the head coaching job of the Pacers head coach a few months later, but due to conflict of interest rules, he can't do both, so he's forced to sell the league. He can't find a buyer in time, as the NBA is obviously no longer interested, and puts everything in a blind trust, but that obviously goes badly, the league is forced to declare bankruptcy, and most of the teams fold midway through the 2001 season. Boom, no more minor league basketball competition. David Stern, ladies and gentlemen.
   * (The CBA would try to restart with some of its original owners regaining team rights, but it only lasted a few years before finally going under for good as the Developmental League expanded.)
   * Anyway, Bob Love would go on to make the Royals roster the next year, then get drafted by the Bucks in their expansion draft, then get traded to the Bulls, where he had a huge impact for almost a decade.

Gola was also the ""first alternate"" to the Olympic team in 1952, which won gold. I don't quite know how alternates for Olympic teams work, but that would be a hell of a trivia answer if he'd made the team.

   * Braun was at one point the record-holder for most points in a single game, with 47, which he set during the 1948 season. 
   * He also played for the Yankees minor league teams as a pitcher for three seasons from 1947-1949, but never got called up, so switched to basketball full-time.
   * Braun also apparently invented the term ""swish,"" which sounds a little bit like Dr. Evil's father inventing the question mark, but hey, someone had to do it.

   * Aguirre doesn't really get enough credit for being the ""missing piece"" of the Bad Boys Pistons, as they traded for him in the middle of the 1989 season and immediately won two titles. Granted, I don't know how much of that was trading for Aguirre, and how much was trading away Adrian Dantley, who Isiah Thomas apparently hated, but whatever. I'm counting it. He's really the only major player from those teams that *doesn't* have his jersey retired by the Pistons, with Thomas, Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman, Vinnie Johnson, Bill Laimbeer, and even coach Chuck Daly all having jerseys retired for them.
   * I mentioned it in Rolando Blackman's section, but it's worth reminding: Aguirre would have been on the 1980 US Olympic team that boycotted the games due to them being in the Soviet Union. I'm fairly confident they would have won gold, but we can't take anything for granted.

   * How many players do you think have three All-NBA selections and a ring and are *not* in the Hall of Fame? Just one: Chauncey Billups. And I do think Billups will get in at some point. (Maybe even next year, because the first-time eligible candidates are Vince Carter, and... that's about it.) Plus, Jordan has an Olympic gold medal... (Billups has a World Cup gold.) I'm not saying DeAndre Jordan *should* be in the Hall of Fame, I'm just saying if it's like 2050 and they're searching for candidates one year, don't be surprised if his name pops up.
   * There are also 42 players who have ever grabbed 10,000+ rebounds in their careers. Only two of them are active: DeAndre Jordan and LeBron. That really surprised me for some reason. (Andre Drummond is close at 9,963. The next closest is Kevin Love at 9,065.)

Noah looked absolutely washed in the bubble and Horford is still chugging along. That's not intended to be a diss to Noah, it just feels like those two are completely different generations to me.

We're going to hit the 100-mark for scores with this batch of players, and I feel like that's when someone can really start making a case for a player as a Hall of Famer. It might not be a *good* case, but there is at least *a* case to be made. I don't think I've said this yet, but for reference points on scores: everyone who has a score over 250 and is eligible for the Hall of Fame is in the Hall of Fame (49 total players). There are 23 players who score between 200 and 250, and 22 of them have been inducted (95.7%). There are 36 players who score between 150 and 200, and 29 of them have been inducted (80.6%). The drop-off for inductees happens fast after that, with 53 players scoring between 100 and 150, with 26 being inducted (49.0%).

There's two ways to look at that. The first is that, since this is scored out of 1000, if a player accomplishes roughly 10-15% of what the greatest players to ever live have done, the have about a 50/50 chance of making it into the Hall of Fame. So, it makes it seem like the Hall of Fame is super easy to get into.

The other way to look at it, is that the guys at the top are so far ahead of everyone else that it's just hard to really comprehend. Oscar Robertson has a score in the 500s. If a player as exceptional as Oscar Robertson only accomplished about half as much as the very, very best of the sport, it should tell you how insanely good the very top tier of this actually is.

Something to think about while you check out today's list of names.

* **205. Dick McGuire - 97.0**

   * Other achievements
      * College Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee (2006)
      * \#15 retired by the New York Knicks
   * McGuire is the only ""old-timey"" Knick to get his jersey retired. And I know most people reading this will say, ""every Knick with their jersey retired is 'old-timey'"" but I mean, *really* ""old-timey,"" like, pre-1970s title teams old-timey. McGuire led the team to three straight Finals in the early 1950s, losing to the Rochester Royals and a bunch of players I guarantee you've never heard of in 1951 (the Kings' only title!) and George Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers the next two years.
   * As of now, Dick and Al McGuire are the only pair of brothers inducted in the Hall of Fame (Dick as a player, Al as a coach.) Reggie and Cheryl Miller are also in there as siblings. (Also, this is totally unrelated, but did you know Reggie and Cheryl have another brother named Darrell who played baseball for the Angels for three seasons? Never gets mentioned.)
   * McGuire also has one of the rare ""double jersey number retirements,"" where the same jersey is retired for two different people. His jersey was retired in 1992 to go alongside Earl Monroe's, which was retired in 1986. Not counting any of the double 6's, the Blazers are the only other team to do this so far, retiring #30 for Terry Porter and Bob Gross, both in 2008.

   * Peak - 130.5
      * 1952-1956
   * Seymour is a perfect example of why the way the NBA keeps track of its own stats and history doesn't make sense. In 1948, Seymour played for the Baltimore Bullets of the BAA. So far, so good. In 1949, he played for the Syracuse Nationals, a team you may have heard of as they became the Philadelphia 76ers. However, in 1949, the Nationals were in the NBL, so, that season's stats/accomplishments don't count toward Seymour's totals (despite the fact that we do have at least some of those numbers.) The next year, 1950, the BAA and NBL merged to create the NBA. So, Seymour is all good again, as the Nationals are now part of the NBA.
   * So we end up with two leagues, both theoretically on equal footing (the NBL was larger and had more history, but the BAA had the East Coast), merging to form the NBA. Yet only the BAA history as counted as ""official"" by the NBA today. The Lakers and Warriors each count one of their titles from these BAA days. (If we counted the NBL titles, most of the winning teams are defunct, but the Pistons would have two more, the Kings one more, and the Lakers one more.)
   * (Just for fun, the Pistons, Lakers, Kings, Sixers, and Hawks are the surviving NBL teams today.)
   * There was a lot of backroom politicking done in the 1940s and 1950s, as to why this happened the way it did, which I won't go into here because it's long and complicated. But why we're still going along with this charade this many years later is beyond me. Either say the NBA started in 1950 (when it did, when the merger happened to form the brand-new league), or take *both* the BAA and NBL stats from before the merger and count them as legitimate. We still have time to celebrate the NBA's proper 75th anniversary in 2025!

   * Nance gets hurt a bit in the ""peak"" portion of this because his All-Star selections are so spread out. He's one of the very few players who has 3+ selections, but they're not within a five-year timeframe. I wish I could give him bonus points just for being cool, but, alas.

   * Brown is the main reason I wanted to include ABA players when I did this. (Also partially Mel Daniels, also partially the first third of Dr. J's career.) He's easily the best player from the ABA to never play in the NBA. You could argue Daniels, but he did end up playing 11 games for the Nets after the merger with minimal impact.
   * Brown was banned by the NBA, as well as the NCAA, (in the same scheme that caught up Connie Hawkins) for point shaving in high school. And it's very unclear to me how much he would have actually been guilty of anything. Much like Hawkins, it seems like Brown's only crime was associating with Jack Molinas (long story short, [the guy was basically a mobster involved in all kinds of illegal things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Molinas#Match_fixing) who had previously played in the NBA). It's not like he *couldn't* have made it in the NBA, he just didn't have the option.
   * He was reinstated by the NBA after the league's merged, but he chose to not play for the NBA, either because he was older (he would've been 34 for the 1977 season) or because he was still pissed about the ban (understandable) or a combination of the two.
   * Anyway, the whole complication of figuring out ABA to NBA relative strength equations and everything is because Jack Molinas was a dick, and the NBA was terrified of even a whiff of scandal.

   * Sometimes I wonder if the Lakers would have three-peated if they had just kept Jones and Nick Van Exel from the 1998 team. That year, the Lakers went 61-21 and lost in the Conference Finals to the Jazz. (Yes, we were *this close* to having Kobe and Jordan in the same NBA Finals. But the Bulls playing a dominant center in Shaq would've been fascinating to watch.) Shaq, Kobe, Jones, and Van Exel all made the All-Star Game that season as well, though Kobe was voted in and wouldn't have been selected without the fan vote. Anyway, the Lakers ended up trading Jones to Charlotte for Glen Rice and Van Exel to Denver for nothing, and signed a few other guys in the intervening year, but the core was still all there: Shaq, Kobe, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Robert Horry... It would have been interesting to say the least. (Van Exel was reportedly traded because he didn't like the coach at the time, Del Harris, and those Lakers had a *lot* of guards, but still.)
   * Jones also started his Lakers career wearing #25, which the Lakers retired for Gail Goodrich when he made the Hall of Fame in 1996. I have yet to find a good source on whether Jones switched to #6 of his own volition, or if it was ""strongly suggested"" to him that he change it, but the fact that he kept it the rest of his career seems like he must have been cool with it.

      * 1947-1950
   * Feerick was a finalist for the very first ""NBA Anniversary Team"" in 1971.  (He didn't make it but I don't have a lot else to say about him, so I'm going to go into this here.) This would have been the 25th Anniversary Team, where the NBA was still really trying to push the BAA founding as it's first season because the BAA guys were still around and wanted their narrative at the top. Anyway, that's why the numbering is messed up now because the 50th Anniversary Team and 75th Anniversary Team would've looked weird if they *weren't* in 1996 and then 2021, respectively.
   * The 25th Anniversary Team was done differently than either the 50th or 75th. Instead of naming the top 25 players of the first 25 years, they just did an analogue of the All-NBA team and named a First and Second Team, with active players being ineligible. Here are the results: First Team - Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman, Bill Russell, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes. Second Team - Bob Davies, Sam Jones, Paul Arizin, Joe Fulks, George Mikan.
   * Feerick and Max Zaslofsky are the only players who were [finalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_25th_Anniversary_Team#Nominees) for that team not currently in the Hall of Fame.

   * The way I keep track of postseason win shares is I take whatever win shares the player accumulated in the postseason, then just slot them into how far his team made it during the postseason (Championship, Finals, or Conference Finals). Porter has the third most Finals Win Shares of any player who never won a title. Elgin Baylor (10.6) and Jimmy Butler (6.9) are the only players ahead of him.
   * He's actually 12th all-time in Finals Win Shares, which is kind of wild, especially since he did that in only two postseasons. The top of that list is: Jerry West, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, Wes Unseld, Shaquille O'Neal, and Jimmy Butler. Not too bad of company, honestly.

   * Love started his career in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, sometimes just shortened to EBL, after failing to make the Cincinnati Royals roster in 1966. This was the league that was once known as the Eastern Pennsylvania Basketball League, founded in 1946, and would later change it's name to the Continental Basketball Association, which ran until 2009. 
   * If you were a kid growing up in the 90s, the CBA was no doubt described to you as ""minor league basketball"" at one point or another. This was sort of true in the 80s and 90s, though there was never any sort of official arrangement between the leagues, it was just a *de facto* state of affairs.
   * Also, if you want to look into some seriously shady stuff, Isiah Thomas bought the league (the whole damn league, every single team) in 1999. The NBA then offered to buy the league from Thomas in 2000, who said no. The NBA then announces it's going to create its own minor league (which became the Developmental League, and later the G-League). Thomas is then offered a the head coaching job of the Pacers head coach a few months later, but due to conflict of interest rules, he can't do both, so he's forced to sell the league. He can't find a buyer in time, as the NBA is obviously no longer interested, and puts everything in a blind trust, but that obviously goes badly, the league is forced to declare bankruptcy, and most of the teams fold midway through the 2001 season. Boom, no more minor league basketball competition. David Stern, ladies and gentlemen.
   * (The CBA would try to restart with some of its original owners regaining team rights, but it only lasted a few years before finally going under for good as the Developmental League expanded.)
   * Anyway, Bob Love would go on to make the Royals roster the next year, then get drafted by the Bucks in their expansion draft, then get traded to the Bulls, where he had a huge impact for almost a decade.

Gola was also the ""first alternate"" to the Olympic team in 1952, which won gold. I don't quite know how alternates for Olympic teams work, but that would be a hell of a trivia answer if he'd made the team.

   * He also played for the Yankees minor league teams as a pitcher for three seasons from 1947-1949, but never got called up, so switched to basketball full-time.

   * Aguirre doesn't really get enough credit for being the ""missing piece"" of the Bad Boys Pistons, as they traded for him in the middle of the 1989 season and immediately won two titles. Granted, I don't know how much of that was trading for Aguirre, and how much was trading away Adrian Dantley, who Isiah Thomas apparently hated, but whatever. I'm counting it. He's really the only major player from those teams that *doesn't* have his jersey retired by the Pistons, with Thomas, Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman, Vinnie Johnson, Bill Laimbeer, and even coach Chuck Daly all having jerseys retired for them.
   * I mentioned it in Rolando Blackman's section, but it's worth reminding: Aguirre would have been on the 1980 US Olympic team that boycotted the games due to them being in the Soviet Union. I'm fairly confident they would have won gold, but we can't take anything for granted.

   * How many players do you think have three All-NBA selections and a ring and are *not* in the Hall of Fame? Just one: Chauncey Billups. And I do think Billups will get in at some point. (Maybe even next year, because the first-time eligible candidates are Vince Carter, and... that's about it.) Plus, Jordan has an Olympic gold medal... (Billups has a World Cup gold.) I'm not saying DeAndre Jordan *should* be in the Hall of Fame, I'm just saying if it's like 2050 and they're searching for candidates one year, don't be surprised if his name pops up.
   * There are also 42 players who have ever grabbed 10,000+ rebounds in their careers. Only two of them are active: DeAndre Jordan and LeBron. That really surprised me for some reason. (Andre Drummond is close at 9,963. The next closest is Kevin Love at 9,065.)

Noah looked absolutely washed in the bubble and Horford is still chugging along. That's not intended to be a diss to Noah, it just feels like those two are completely different generations to me.

Is it disingenuous to say Dirk and Iverson “carried” their respect teams in the 2001 NBA Finals?,nba,"I am in no way trying to discredit how great Iverson and Dirk were for their teams or how good those playoff runs were. They were clearly the superstars and #1 options.

However, I often see many people claimed that Dirk and AI absolutely just dragged a team of bums to the Finals (In Dirk’s case, winning it). 

Am I wrong to say those teams outside of Dirk and AI to be pretty solid? 

In those playoffs, the Sixers had the reigning DPOY Dikembe Mutumbo, 6MOY Aaron McKie, even COTY in Larry Brown. They also had solid enough players like Eric Snow and Tyrone Hill. They were a great defensive team. 

Of course I’m not saying they were a historical all-time team or anything and they had many flaws (including offense outside AI where he had to carry an incredible load) but I don’t think it’s fair to call them bums AI carried.

The 2011 Mavericks team is also like this to me. Dirks title run that year may be the greatest Finals run ever and on paper that Mavs team shouldn’t have lost to the Heat, creating an incredible underdog story when they sent the Big 3 packing.

However, I also think that people are doing a disservice to the team outside of Dirk. Again, definitely the superstar who was responsible for the majority of their success in the playoffs but this team is damn solid to me.

You’ve got future DPOY Tyson Chandler anchoring the defense as one of the best defensive centers in the league, an old but still good Jason Kidd who still could hold up on defense and was still an incredible passer and playmaker as a role player. Jason Terry a pretty good scoring guard, out of his prime Marion who could still defend, score and rebound. Other solid role players like Barea and Deshawn Stevenson.

Again, Dirks supporting cast in 2011 isn’t legendary or anything but I think it’s very solid.

I don't really understand double dribbling or traveling,nba,"I see some guys get called for it when they walk with the ball in their hands, but I don't get it. I also read that you cannot stop and dribble again without bouncing and that you can't grab the ball with both hands and I see people doing that all the time, especially when holding the ball against a defender.

How many Pelicans would it take to reasonably evacuate Zion Williamson in the event of a flood?,nba,"I am here to answer the question everyone is dying to know the answer to. TL;DR at the bottom.    
    
The official state bird of Louisiana is the brown pelican (*Pelecanus occidentalis*), so I will be using this species for my calculations. The brown pelican has an average wingspan of around 80 inches, with an average weight of around 7.5 pounds. There actually is very little information on the lifting capacity of a flying pelican, so we'll have to do some guesswork by comparing it to another species.    
    
In order to create a proper comparison, we want to eliminate unnecessarily variables. One variable that greatly contributes to the lift a bird can produce is the surface  area of its wings. Therefore, we will compare the brown pelican to a species with a similar wingspan. The bald eagle (*Haliaeetus leucocephalis*) has an average wingspan of approximately 81"", and weighs around 10lb. Males and females vary greatly in size, so I am using the average weight and wingspan of the two.    
    
So, we have determined that brown pelican and bald eagles are roughly similar in size. Per Google, bald eagles can carry around 5-6 pounds, so we'll call it 5.5. However, bald eagles are some of the strongest birds in the world, so it wouldn't make sense to assume a pelican of the same size could carry the same amount. Their muscular and skeletal structure is not built for the same kind of speed and power as that of an eagle. However, we must also consider that they are lighter than an eagle of the same wingspan, meaning they have a lower pull of gravity to overcome. So, considering all this information, and through a very scientific method of pulling numbers out of my ass (something this sub is likely familiar with), I will guess that an average pelican can lift roughly 3.247 pounds.    
     
From here on out, the math is simple: Zion's official weight, per NBA.com, is 284 lb. Divide his weight by 3.247 pounds, and we can conclude that it would take around 88 pelicans (87.5 to be more exact, but we have to round to a whole number of pelicans) to air-lift Zion out of New Orleans in the event of a catastrophic flood.    
     
But wait! This is of course ignoring the weight of the cables used to attach him to said 88 pelicans, which is very critical to our calculations. Ignoring such added weight could mean the difference between a safe rescue and sleeping with the fishes.    
    
Even 1/4"" steel rope is much too heavy, weighing 0.116 lb/ft. Instead, we will use 1/4"" nylon rope, weighing 0.0167 lb/ft. In order to have enough space for the pelicans to adequately fly, I will estimate that we will need around 40 feet of rope per pelican. That equates to 0.667 pounds per pelican. This takes our new max lifting weight per pelican (lb/pel) to 2.48. Re-doing the calculations, we now need 110.07 pelicans, which rounds up to 111. We should probably add in 5 pounds for a secure harness as well to make sure Zion doesn't fall out, plus 2 pounds of clothing to be safe, bringing our total pelican count to 117.34, or 118.    
    
However, there is one more crucial aspect we must consider: factor of safety (FoS). This is an engineering principle that expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load. This is because calculations are not always perfect, so we need to account for that error and be positive we are creating something safe.

**TL;DR: 235 pelicans**    
    
Edit: [Bonus content](https://imgur.com/a/Xnj6TSJ)",t5_2qo4s,4302,783,"How many Pelicans would it take to reasonably evacuate Zion Williamson in the event of a flood?I am here to answer the question everyone is dying to know the answer to. TL;DR at the bottom.    
    
The official state bird of Louisiana is the brown pelican (*Pelecanus occidentalis*), so I will be using this species for my calculations. The brown pelican has an average wingspan of around 80 inches, with an average weight of around 7.5 pounds. There actually is very little information on the lifting capacity of a flying pelican, so we'll have to do some guesswork by comparing it to another species.    
    
In order to create a proper comparison, we want to eliminate unnecessarily variables. One variable that greatly contributes to the lift a bird can produce is the surface  area of its wings. Therefore, we will compare the brown pelican to a species with a similar wingspan. The bald eagle (*Haliaeetus leucocephalis*) has an average wingspan of approximately 81"", and weighs around 10lb. Males and females vary greatly in size, so I am using the average weight and wingspan of the two.    
    
So, we have determined that brown pelican and bald eagles are roughly similar in size. Per Google, bald eagles can carry around 5-6 pounds, so we'll call it 5.5. However, bald eagles are some of the strongest birds in the world, so it wouldn't make sense to assume a pelican of the same size could carry the same amount. Their muscular and skeletal structure is not built for the same kind of speed and power as that of an eagle. However, we must also consider that they are lighter than an eagle of the same wingspan, meaning they have a lower pull of gravity to overcome. So, considering all this information, and through a very scientific method of pulling numbers out of my ass (something this sub is likely familiar with), I will guess that an average pelican can lift roughly 3.247 pounds.    
     
From here on out, the math is simple: Zion's official weight, per NBA.com, is 284 lb. Divide his weight by 3.247 pounds, and we can conclude that it would take around 88 pelicans (87.5 to be more exact, but we have to round to a whole number of pelicans) to air-lift Zion out of New Orleans in the event of a catastrophic flood.    
     
But wait! This is of course ignoring the weight of the cables used to attach him to said 88 pelicans, which is very critical to our calculations. Ignoring such added weight could mean the difference between a safe rescue and sleeping with the fishes.    
    
Even 1/4"" steel rope is much too heavy, weighing 0.116 lb/ft. Instead, we will use 1/4"" nylon rope, weighing 0.0167 lb/ft. In order to have enough space for the pelicans to adequately fly, I will estimate that we will need around 40 feet of rope per pelican. That equates to 0.667 pounds per pelican. This takes our new max lifting weight per pelican (lb/pel) to 2.48. Re-doing the calculations, we now need 110.07 pelicans, which rounds up to 111. We should probably add in 5 pounds for a secure harness as well to make sure Zion doesn't fall out, plus 2 pounds of clothing to be safe, bringing our total pelican count to 117.34, or 118.    
    
However, there is one more crucial aspect we must consider: factor of safety (FoS). This is an engineering principle that expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load. This is because calculations are not always perfect, so we need to account for that error and be positive we are creating something safe. Since we are designing a flying apparatus, the usual FoS for aircraft is 1.5. However, due to the inaccurate nature and guesswork of the calculations, and the valuable nature of the asset as an NBA superstar, we will use a FoS of 2. This brings our final total to 234.68, which means **we would need 235 pelicans to evacuate Zion Williamson in the event of a flood.**

It's time to get rid of the 6 foul limit,nba,"It's bad for competition, bad for the fans, and great for fixing games. Two quick cheap whistles on an important player? Well they're on the bench and when they return they have to play timid now. Fans robbed, competition robbed, and for what? What's the point of the limit? So one guy doesn't go crazy just Laimbeering it up all day? You could still easily do that with the limit and just send in end of bench guys for that. 

Does it even stop fouling? Is that even the aim? I'd argue the only thing effectively stopping fouling is the fact that it turns into free points. That's already a significant penalty. Free throws are the most efficient shot in the game, you don't want to give those up. Keep the team foul penalty, that is working.

But why the 6 foul limit? What's even the actual goal of that rule? How is it better for the game to have people not being able to play their hardest? What is that helping? I would bet that the amount of fouls would barely budge at all if they got rid of the limit.

The plus side? Refs lose a tool to ruin a game. Competition is about who is best not who got a bad whistle. Fans don't have to suffer the bullshit. Defense will be more aggressive, leading to more competitive games.

It's a bit easier to imagine ""Why did Tyrese Haliburton never win a championship? by Secret Base"" just because he plays for Indiana now, but Indy has historically been run pretty well so they're bound to get lucky with the right group at some point, right? Curious as to others' thoughts."

What do you guys think of this all-time starting 5 ?,nba,"Warning: This is all my opinion and English is not my mother tongue!

Center: Hakeem Olajuwon - Honorable Mentions: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal

I choose Hakeem because of his impeccable Defense. Kareem is on par with him in the blocking/contesting department but doesn't have the pick pocket skills of the Dream. Shaq's Defense doesn't come close to either of them. Offensively even though Shaq is the most ""dominant"" of them i see him as a liability when it comes to close games in the 4th quarter. He is so reliant on getting into the paint as he has no midrange scoring capabilities and is one of the worst FT shooters of all time. Hakeem has one of the deepest bags ever seen in the Post. He can burn you with his magnificent spins and beat you to the basket or punish you with his very reliant midrange scoring. Kareem is on par with Hakeem as he can get a basket at will with his infamous skyhook. Rebounding wise they are all very equal. But i choose Hakeem over Kareem as he is better on D.

Power Forward: Tim Duncan - Honorable Mentions: /

Tim Duncan is so far ahead of his competition in the PF position. He is only keen on winning and will do anything to help his team. Duncan can help Hakeem defend in the post but he is also capable of defending on the perimeter. On offense Duncan can space the Floor with his midrange scoring or go into the post. His playmaking is decent just as his general awareness and understanding of the game of basketball.

Small Forward: Larry Bird - Honorable Mentions: Scottie Pippen, Lebron James, Dennis Rodman

I know there are better SF's than Rodman or Pippen but i choose them in all-time starting 5 bc of their unselfish playstyle. Scottie is one of the greatest 2 way Players of all time. Rodman and Pippen can lockdown anyone on the court. Rodman is one of the greatest rebounders of all time and Pippen is also a great Playmaker. I won't talk about Lebron here as i start him in a different position. But at the end of the day Larry Bird is a great defender too, not as great as the other two but he can definitely hold his ground and in my lineup he doesn't have to be the best at it. Bird is here for his floor spacing, all-around scoring threat and exceptional playmaking ability.

Shooting Guard: Michael Jordan - Honorable Mentions: Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade

The Greatest Player of all Time must be in this starting 5 and it is MJ. What can i say that has not been said about him. Top 10 Defender of all time, best defender at his position, great playmaking, can take the pressure, one of the best scorer's of all time. Mike can take the last shot like no one else. He always gives his maximum effort and is great on both ends of the floor.

Point Guard: Lebron James - Honorable Mentions: Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry, Oscar Robertson

I choose Lebron at the Point. Magic is the greatest Playmaker of all time but he is a liability on defense and is less of a scoring threat than Bron. Stephen Curry has the scoring with decent playmaking and can space the floor like no one else but he is even more of a liability on D. Robertson is close to what Lebron is but is not as much of a scoring threat. He is on par with Lebron in Rebounding but James has the better passing ability. Lebron is a great Help defender and this is exactly what this team needs. MJ, TD, LB and HO can all lockdown their opponent and Bron would be there to help.

Style of play:

You have Bron and Bird being the primary playmakers, but can also score and pop off if it is needed. Duncan and Jordan are the secondary playmakers and with 4 great passers in one team you would have insane ball movement. Lebron and Bird also provide the 3 point threat to space the floor. Either of them can still go in there and get themselves high percentage looks. Jordan can shoot from anywhere inside the arc but can also finish superbly at the rim. Duncan and Hakeem can both score on their own beyond the paint. The opposing team would have a very hard time to stop this offense from scoring. On the defensive side of the game this team is even better. The worst defender to switch onto here is Lebron a 6'9 250 pound guy that can hold his own very well and is a great transitional defender. The smallest guy in this lineup is MJ at 6'6. But they are all still very athletic and cant be outpaced by a small ball lineup. Duncan in his younger days was very explosive too. Going into the paint is a Nightmare. You have to pass Duncan and Hakeem first and even if you make it Lebron comes from the back and slams your layup into outer space.",t5_2qo4s,4570,842,"What do you guys think of this all-time starting 5 ?Warning: This is all my opinion and English is not my mother tongue!

Here is my prediction for the season opener and Xmas Games:

#NBA 2023-24 Season Opener

|Time (ET)|Road| |Home|
|-:|:-|:-:|:-|
|7:00pm|Milwaukee Bucks|@|Philadelphia 76ers|
|9:30pm|Los Angeles Lakers|@|Denver Nuggets|

* Ring ceremony, of course. With the league biggest star visiting the defending champs. Would make for a good rating game. Also a WCF rematch, with trash talking between Denver coach and LeBron.
* This is the year we'll move away from the LeBron-Steph-KD-Kawhi superstar foursome as headliners. The NBA will start to shift to the international MVP trio of Giannis-Jokic-Embiid, so we'll let them headline the season opener.

|Time (ET)|Road| |Home|

|7:00pm|Milwaukee Bucks|@|Philadelphia 76ers|
|9:30pm|Los Angeles Lakers|@|Denver Nuggets|

* Ring ceremony, of course. With the league biggest star visiting the defending champs. Would make for a good rating game. Also a WCF rematch, with trash talking between Denver coach and LeBron.
* This is the year we'll move away from the LeBron-Steph-KD-Kawhi superstar foursome as headliners. The NBA will start to shift to the international MVP trio of Giannis-Jokic-Embiid, so we'll let them headline the season opener.

Between KD and Hakeem who is the more skilled player when considering offense and defense?,nba,"If we are using a 0-10 scale to rate skills, I would rate KD’s offensive skill set at a 10. There’s not many players that can do what he can do on the court. He has the ability to shoot with the best of them and drible extremely well for his size.  Defensively I would give him a rating of 6. I think he’s an above average defender. He definitely improved on the defensive side of the ball when he arrived in golden state. Overall score of 16. 

For Hakeem, his defense is probably what stands out. As a two time defensive player of the year and a 5 time NBA all defensive first team, he would have to be a 10 on that side of the ball. Offensively he was extremely skilled and gifted as well. His post game and foot work are a highlight of game. I would say he’s a solid 8 on that side of the ball. Overall score of 18. 

This might be a flawed way of rating skill levels but let me know what you guys think and who you think the more skilled player is.",t5_2qo4s,953,193,"Between KD and Hakeem who is the more skilled player when considering offense and defense?If we are using a 0-10 scale to rate skills, I would rate KD’s offensive skill set at a 10.

"Are Blake Griffin, George Hill, Andre Igoudala, and Boban Marjanovic going to retire this offseason?",nba,"None of these three players are signed.

Blake is 34.
Iggy is 39.
Boban is 34.
George is 37.

Do any of them have anything left in the tank to contribute to an NBA team? 

Other players I wonder about are Dragic (37), Bismack (only 30), Gorgui Deng (33), and Taj Gibson (38) but I think all these guys have some kind of veteran presence with their last team that will keep them around.

For the Clippers, it'd be ideal if Blake could get a one year deal elsewhere so he could be brought back in the 2024-25 season on a 'retirement tour' the season the new arena opens as a ticket seller.

What player fusion can beat Michael Jordan + LeBron James?,nba,"LeBron Jordan is basically the TWO GOATS combined. The guy has the quickest first step combined with the most powerful drive game of all time and the deadliest midrange of all time. He is the most athletic basketball player too. Elite perimeter defender but is best at playing free safety. High BBIQ and has great vision and elite playmaking.

His only weakness is that he's extremely ball dominant, subpar 3 point shooter, and doesn't provide consistent rim protection like an elite center.

Note: You cannot use LeBron or Jordan again",t5_2qo4s,601,98,"What player fusion can beat Michael Jordan + LeBron James?LeBron Jordan is basically the TWO GOATS combined.

"If Mike Breen and Kevin Harlan retire eventually because of their ages, who would replace them?",nba," So for Mike's replacement, it gotta be one of the espn commentators and only person I can think of is mark Jones and he even replaced Mike for first 2 games of 2022 finals and did pretty good. His whole commentary of Kings vs warriors and lakers vs memphis was pretty entertaining and has some catchphrases like 'HOTTER THAN FISH GREASE"" smthing like that.

For Kevin harlan, I think it will be Brian Anderson, considering how he has replaced some of Kevin harlan roles and games(around 2nd round ish) before Marv Albert retired, but his commentary is little too lame and I cannot think of any of his famous calls or catchphrase he had.

I would like to have Ian Eagles to replace Kevin harlan role if he retires. He exerts so much energy when he commentates and he has some catchy phrases ""OH, blah blah ON RACK ATTACK' 'HE IS NOT HUMAN' etc. He also has done amazing commentaries during nfl season like Kevin Harlan did.

How many rings would Shaq have won if you reversed the order of his teams?,nba,"Let’s assume all of the other players on the team remain the same and you just plug Shaq in for the same amount of years that he played with the original team 

#1993-1996 (4 yrs with Boston Celtics) 

- 1993 Celtics went 48-34 irl and lost in the first round to Charlotte. Shaq steps in as McHale/Parish play in their twilight years and makes a big impact as a rookie playing alongside Reggie Lewis. They lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Bulls in 5 games. 

- 94, 95, and 96 Celtics all won between 32 and 35 games irl. With Shaq on the squad, alongside Dee Brown, Dino Radja and an ancient Dominique Wilkins … Boston makes the playoffs these years but only wins one playoff series in the three years combined, losing to stronger teams such as Chicago, New York, and Indiana. 

#1997-2004 (8 years with the Cleveland Cavaliers)

- 97 and 98 Cavs, these teams were competent. Winning 42 and 47 games respectively, adding Shaq to a talented young core, however they cannot get past the powerhouses of Chicago, Miami and New York. 

- 99 to 2003 seasons, Shaq’s 5 season prime is wasted in Clevland. Cavs teams that won no more than 32 games in any of those years irl. Shaq is paired with Zyndruras Ilgauskas, Andre Miller, Ricky Davis and Carlos Boozer and he even drags them to the playoffs a few times. Even in a weak Eastern Conference, they are unable to win a single playoff series in this 5-year stretch, effectively wasting Shaquille’s prime. They get beat up physically by teams like Detroit and Indiana.

- 2003-04 season, everything changes when the team drafts local phenom LeBron James out of high school. Shaq and LeBron experience growing pains together but eventually the team hits their stride, even going on a 14-game winning streak late in the season. The Cavs win 46 games (35-47 irl) good for the #4 seed in the East. They sweep the 5th seeded Miami Heat in Round One and upset the 61-win #1 seed Indiana Pacers in Round 2 to meet the Detroit Pistons in the ECF. A physical series, LeBron shows his youth and Shaq is held in check by Detroit’s frontline and Detroit wins in 6 games en route to a Finals win.

#2005-2008 (3.5 years with Phoenix)

- 2004-05 season: Shaq’s contract expires with Cleveland, and they cannot afford to re-sign the aging big man. He tests free agency and lands in Phoenix with Steve Nash and Amare Stoudemire. In 2004-05 the Suns go 67-15, (62-20 irl)… Nash wins MVP and Shaq experiences a resurgence. After sweeping Memphis and Dallas, Phoenix goes toe-to-toe with the dynasty of San Antonio. The Spurs rugged defense holds Nash in check and Shaq hurts the Suns’ floor spacing. Despite having home court advantage, PHX goes down 3-2 in the series, but wins Game 6 in a 20-point blowout to force a Game 7. San Antonio prevails in OT 92-87 and goes on to win their third title in 6 years.

- 2005-06 season: Another 60-win season in PHX and they find themselves in the WCF. Only this time, the Spurs are not there. Dallas defeated SA in the second round and PHX defeats the mighty Dirk Nowitzki in 6 games and Shaq advances to the Finals for the first time in his disappointing 13 year career. Matched up with Miami, the Suns blow the doors off the Heat and win the title in 5 games. Steve Nash wins FMVP.

- 2006-07 season: Shaq is riddled with injuries and struggles with his playing weight. He plays in only 40 games, but Phoenix still wins 60 games for the third consecutive year. Unfortunately, they are matched up with San Antonio in Round 2 and once again, Duncan outduels Shaq and defeats Phoenix in a Game 7 en route to their 4th championship.

#2008 and 09 seasons (1.5 years with Miami)

- 2007-08 season: midway through the season, D’Antoni becomes frustrated with Shaq’s lack of conditioning and increasing signs of old age. Far from the dominant presence he once was, he is dealt at the trade deadline to Miami Heat to be paired with young star Dwyane Wade. The duo gels and they go 45-37, to earn the 4th seed in the East. After squeaking past his former co-star Lebron James in 7 games in Round 1, they are matched up with the 66-16 Boston Celtics who promptly defeat them in 5 games.

- 2008-09 season: Shaq plays in 75 games for the first time since the 2000 season and averages 18 points and 8 rebounds while shooting 60% from the field. Dwyane Wade ascends as a superstar, averaging 32 ppg and Miami advances to the ECF, defeating Boston in Round 2 thanks to KG being sidelined. In the ECF, they get the best of LeBron James for the second straight season to advance to the Finals, where they lose to Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in 6 games.

#2009-10 season (one year with the Lakers)

In a controversial move, Shaquille signs a one-year contract with the Lakers just two months after losing to them in the NBA Finals. Shaq showed signs of aging in the 2009 Finals as he struggled to stop Paul Gasol. Shaq accepts his role as the backup center and seeks to mentor a young Andrew Bynum. The Lakers go 58-24 (57-25 irl), Shaq averages 10 points and 7 rebounds off the bench and the team cruises through the West and eventually defeat Boston his former team, giving the Lakers their 16th championship, Kobe wins FMVP.

#2010-11 season (one year with Orlando)

Shaq is not re-signed by the Lakers, and instead goes back to the Sunshine State, signing a one year deal with Orlando. Hopes are high as the team still has much of their nucleas from a squad that made the Finals less than two years ago. Shaq comes off the bench and is happy to mentor Dwight Howard. However, one day after practice, Dwight Howard puts on a “Superman” T shirt and O’Neal demands he removes it. Howard refuses and a verbal altercation quickly tuns physical. The two have to be separated by Stan Van Gundy and Shaq abruptly announces his retirement later that week on Twitter.


TL;DR, If you reverse the order of Shaq’s teams, he would have won only 2 championships and 0 Finals MVPs.",t5_2qo4s,5933,1057,"How many rings would Shaq have won if you reversed the order of his teams?Let’s assume all of the other players on the team remain the same and you just plug Shaq in for the same amount of years that he played with the original team 

#1993-1996 (4 yrs with Boston Celtics) 

- 1993 Celtics went 48-34 irl and lost in the first round to Charlotte. Shaq steps in as McHale/Parish play in their twilight years and makes a big impact as a rookie playing alongside Reggie Lewis. They lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Bulls in 5 games. 

- 94, 95, and 96 Celtics all won between 32 and 35 games irl. With Shaq on the squad, alongside Dee Brown, Dino Radja and an ancient Dominique Wilkins … Boston makes the playoffs these years but only wins one playoff series in the three years combined, losing to stronger teams such as Chicago, New York, and Indiana. 

#1997-2004 (8 years with the Cleveland Cavaliers)

- 97 and 98 Cavs, these teams were competent. Winning 42 and 47 games respectively, adding Shaq to a talented young core, however they cannot get past the powerhouses of Chicago, Miami and New York. 

- 99 to 2003 seasons, Shaq’s 5 season prime is wasted in Clevland. Cavs teams that won no more than 32 games in any of those years irl. Shaq is paired with Zyndruras Ilgauskas, Andre Miller, Ricky Davis and Carlos Boozer and he even drags them to the playoffs a few times. Even in a weak Eastern Conference, they are unable to win a single playoff series in this 5-year stretch, effectively wasting Shaquille’s prime. They get beat up physically by teams like Detroit and Indiana.

- 2003-04 season, everything changes when the team drafts local phenom LeBron James out of high school. Shaq and LeBron experience growing pains together but eventually the team hits their stride, even going on a 14-game winning streak late in the season. The Cavs win 46 games (35-47 irl) good for the #4 seed in the East. They sweep the 5th seeded Miami Heat in Round One and upset the 61-win #1 seed Indiana Pacers in Round 2 to meet the Detroit Pistons in the ECF. A physical series, LeBron shows his youth and Shaq is held in check by Detroit’s frontline and Detroit wins in 6 games en route to a Finals win.

#2005-2008 (3.5 years with Phoenix)

- 2004-05 season: Shaq’s contract expires with Cleveland, and they cannot afford to re-sign the aging big man. He tests free agency and lands in Phoenix with Steve Nash and Amare Stoudemire. In 2004-05 the Suns go 67-15, (62-20 irl)… Nash wins MVP and Shaq experiences a resurgence. After sweeping Memphis and Dallas, Phoenix goes toe-to-toe with the dynasty of San Antonio. The Spurs rugged defense holds Nash in check and Shaq hurts the Suns’ floor spacing. Despite having home court advantage, PHX goes down 3-2 in the series, but wins Game 6 in a 20-point blowout to force a Game 7. San Antonio prevails in OT 92-87 and goes on to win their third title in 6 years.

- 2005-06 season: Another 60-win season in PHX and they find themselves in the WCF. Only this time, the Spurs are not there. Dallas defeated SA in the second round and PHX defeats the mighty Dirk Nowitzki in 6 games and Shaq advances to the Finals for the first time in his disappointing 13 year career. Matched up with Miami, the Suns blow the doors off the Heat and win the title in 5 games. Steve Nash wins FMVP.

- 2006-07 season: Shaq is riddled with injuries and struggles with his playing weight. He plays in only 40 games, but Phoenix still wins 60 games for the third consecutive year. Unfortunately, they are matched up with San Antonio in Round 2 and once again, Duncan outduels Shaq and defeats Phoenix in a Game 7 en route to their 4th championship.

#2008 and 09 seasons (1.5 years with Miami)

- 2007-08 season: midway through the season, D’Antoni becomes frustrated with Shaq’s lack of conditioning and increasing signs of old age. Far from the dominant presence he once was, he is dealt at the trade deadline to Miami Heat to be paired with young star Dwyane Wade. The duo gels and they go 45-37, to earn the 4th seed in the East. After squeaking past his former co-star Lebron James in 7 games in Round 1, they are matched up with the 66-16 Boston Celtics who promptly defeat them in 5 games.

- 2008-09 season: Shaq plays in 75 games for the first time since the 2000 season and averages 18 points and 8 rebounds while shooting 60% from the field. Dwyane Wade ascends as a superstar, averaging 32 ppg and Miami advances to the ECF, defeating Boston in Round 2 thanks to KG being sidelined.

Note : I used total points for the duo and then divided by the number of games played instead of adding the points per game for each player because for the 2002 Lakers, Shaq and Kobe scored 145 and 107 points respectively whose sum of 252 divided by 4 is exactly 63. The 2017 finals duo of LeBron and Kyrie scored 168 and 147 total points whose sum of 315 divided by 4 is also exactly 63.

If you combine the basketball reference PPG for each player, it isn't accurate as it is 36.3 + 26.8 for Shaq and Kobe which is 63.1 (0.1 more than 2017 LeBron and Kyie) but in reality they had the exact same PPG at 63.

&amp;#x200B;

Also it still blows my mind how LeBron &amp; Kyrie up such insane states and barely avoided getting swept because of a historic shooting night. The 2017 Warriors were that good. Absolutely insane offensive performances from both sides in that series.

PF: 2018 Pelicans Anthony Davis (szn where he’d drop crazy stat lines)
C: 1994 or 95 Hakeem Olajuwon 

This lineup literally has it all in my opinion. 

LeBron at point has the capacity to do whatever is required from the team. Be it playmaking or scoring. 

Jordan is the ultimate closer so thats a given. 

KD is a gifted scorer and in 2018, I think he really had his best shooting season. 

AD is my choice here over KG and Duncan simply because I think he can defend both KG and Duncan, but he can also extend the floor to the 3point line unlike the other two, and he is better defensively than Dirk. (Again I’m using prime AD from the Pelicans who went god mode by himself against the Warriors)

Hakeem was an MVP who I think could easily defend any other Center including Shaq. Prime Shaq was shut down by Ben Wallace but I’m supposed to believe somehow Hakeem couldn’t do the same? Hakeem is not only bigger than Wallace, but he’s also better defensively than every other center, so I don’t see him being a liability offensively or defensively in a 5 on 5.

The in-season tournament winner should get to pick their 1st round opponent if in playoffs (or a play-in spot),nba,"I’ll probably grow to like the in season tournament idea more but I still think itd be more interesting with some sort of tie in to the playoffs.

"If it’s acknowledged that the NBA advances in talent and competition over time, then why isn’t Wilt the consensus goat?",nba,"Every individual “GOAT” has dominated in their own era. LeBron obviously is facing some of the best competition the world has ever seen.

Trae Young is not a top 10 PG and does not play winning basketball. He's the type of player that will never win because of his playstyle,nba,"

People for some reason hype up his playoff achievements like he's been great in the postseason. Trae Young's career playoff averages are 26ppg/3rpg/9apg/4tov on 53% TS. 


Trae in the playoffs is an inefficient chucker who is turnover prone and doesn't play defense. I continuously see him well-regarded among fans and I don't really see it. He's the exact type of high volume, empty stat player that we've seen never win anything serious as a #1 option (ie Westbrook), and his style of play doesn't lend itself to being a #2 option either since he provides nothing on the defensive end and does nothing on offense when the ball isn't in his hands. Him leading the league and volume stats (total points and total assists) doesn't change any of this. It just means he's stayed relatively healthy and has high usage.

"I love Jamal Murray, but can we wait till next season to put him in the top 20?",nba,"Recency and winning bias is insane. I love Jamal Murray, Jokic, MPJ and the Nuggets. Im a Hawks fan first and I love Steph, but the Nuggets are my favorite team to watch and have been since the bubble. 

I thought Murray was underrated after the bubble when he had a really good 2020-21 season before he got hurt and people didn’t notice or care at all.  

Now that Denver has won, and Murray definitely had an incredible playoff run, people are overrating him in my opinion. 

I definitely think he’s top 25 and all star caliber no question, but I think people underestimate how hard it is to be a #1 option through the entirety of the regular season then deliver a deep playoff run as a #1 option. 

I believe Steph, Luka, Booker, Dame, Spida, Trae, Ja, Fox and Brunson, all could’ve done what Mal did last playoffs or more, production wise as a #2 option in their own way.  

But I KNOW these guys as #1 options can lead a team to the playoffs. Jamal played next to not only the best player in the NBA, but a top 20 player ALL-TIME. All those other guards I listed would benefit greatly from the spacing that the entire Denver team provides in general, not just Joker. 

They can’t afford to average 18 on okay shooting for 10 games because they don’t have guys like Jokic, MPJ, and AG to take up the slack, while Jamal has proven to be inconsistent thus far in his career in the RS. 

What he did was still amazing as a scorer and closer for Denver, but I can’t put him over those other guards until he at least puts together an All-NBA caliber regular season similar to a JB or Kyrie as a #2.

What NBA team should I support?,nba,"Hi. I'm a new NBA fan from Ireland, and for the next season I want to find a team to support. If you could share your input, I'd really appreciate it! I love the sport.

Because not every ‘All Star’ is created equal: 

**Tier 1: MJ**

**Tier 2: Superstars** (LBJ, Joker, Giannis, KD, Steph Curry)

\-Generational talent, most likely in the top 50 greatest players of all time. Only a handful in the NBA. Iconic in some sense. 

\-There’s an aspect to their game you’ve never seen before and it’s exceptional. 

\-They define their generation. You can’t tell the narrative of this era without mentioning their name. 

\-HOF bound and maybe a statue lol

**Tier 3: Franchise player:** 

Examples: Dirk Nowitzki, Paul Pierce, Jayson Tatum, Luka

&amp;#x200B;

* A franchise player that could realistically take you to the NBA finals. They are consistently on the NBA All Star team, and chosen to be a member of the first team or second team ) 
* Very talented, however they’re not game changing in any shape or form. 
* Hall of Fame bound

**Tier 4:** **Perennial All Star**

Examples: James Harden, Jalen Brown,, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, KAT, Khris Middleton, Booker, Klay Thompson

&amp;#x200B;

* He may be your franchise player, but you’re not very confident he’s going to take you to the promise land
* Talented, but glaring weaknesses in his game. 
* He’s going to need a strong second option to support him and a great coach to compensate for his short comings. 
* HOF bound likely but not guaranteed. (NBA HOF is very forgiving lol)
* They tend to underperform in the playoffs, lack leadership, or not as well rounded on both sides of the ball as the above tiers. 

**Tier 5:**  **Second rate All Star:**  Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Dejounte Murray, 

* He’s not your franchise player …by choice. 
* He will not lead you deep into the playoffs or the NBA Finals. 
* He is regarded by many as a ‘Robin’, not a ‘Batman’. 
* He is a second option at best
* He is consistent in his statistics, unlike a role player. 

**Tier 6:**  **Occasional All Star:**  Examples: Al Horford, Fred VanVleet

The unlikely reason Ben Simmons will return to form this season,nba,"Dante Exum. Dante and Ben were childhood friends in Australia, both the children of Americans who had moved to Australia to play in the NBL and married a local. I won’t rehash the careers of either here, but I do feel it’s worth pointing out one factor. The decline of Ben Simmons started during the ‘21 post season and Dante stopped playing in the NBA at the end of the ‘21 regular season. The lack of childhood friend that he could compare himself to left Ben directionless and lost in this new version of the NBA, so different to the years before when he knew that he would always be able to look across to the Utah (or Houston or Cleveland) bench and see his old friend sitting there, crutches by his side, and give him a friendly nod that meant “can you believe it? We’re here, we made it,” before passing up an open 3 to drive to the basket and pass it out to for a contested long 2. 

But now, the Mavs have thrown Simmons a lifeline and retrieved his friend from the depths of European basketball, giving Simmons the chance to, once more, be one of the most average All-Star players of all time. Perhaps more importantly, they have also given the fans, casuals and nephews of the NBA the opportunity to purchase a property on Exum Island, the most peaceful and idyllic location in all of world sports.

I mean, maybe except for the Clippers where people were kind of expecting them to be fun and good because Blake was hyped up as hell and CP3 was hyped up  as hell at the time. But still lob city was fun for a year or two and Deandre Jordan went all nba which is good. 

But the Rockets, there was a large talking point about both he and Harden are too ball dominant. turns out they worked awesome and they had a historic offense that year. Not to mention, none of us thought that any team would even give the Warriors a run for their money when KD joined. They took them to 7. I mean, they didn't win but it's disingenuous to think people really believed in them.

I mean, maybe except for the Clippers where people were kind of expecting them to be fun and good because Blake was hyped up as hell and CP3 was hyped up  as hell at the time. But still lob city was fun for a year or two and Deandre Jordan went all nba which is good. 

But the Rockets, there was a large talking point about both he and Harden are too ball dominant. turns out they worked awesome and they had a historic offense that year. Not to mention, none of us thought that any team would even give the Warriors a run for their money when KD joined. They took them to 7. I mean, they didn't win but it's disingenuous to think people really believed in them.

&gt;This morning, unexpectedly, I was informed that my services were no longer needed at ESPN. Although shocked and dismayed with the suddenness of it all, I would like to thank ESPN and all the staff of the NBA ESPN crew for allowing me to be a part of the organization for the past 15+ years. I would also like to thank the NBA fans watching at home and in the arenas throughout the league for all of your support. To the NBA, a heartfelt thank you for allowing a kid to continue to accomplish his dreams.

&gt;It has been an honor to sit beside tWo LEGENDS in the business, who are like brothers to me, Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy, and learn so much from them. Lisa Salters is a GOAT and like a sister to me and I'm so proud of the work she continues to do. To the best producer in the world, and my friend, Tim Corrigan, I give the utmost gratitude and thanks for always inspiring and supporting me. To all of the staff and crew, that may have never been seen on camera... please know that you were always seen by me and so greatly appreciated.

&gt;Finally, I wish greater measures of success to the new ESPN team. May they continue to elevate this game that has given me a home and a life. I leave ESPN with nothing but gratitude, all the while knowing that my highest praise goes to God! Through it all, He has always sustained me and His grace allows me to know that there are greater blessings ahead. I look forward to what He has in store next.

2 interesting NBA league ideas (random thoughts),nba,We have NBA Games and NBA Summer League games. Those are similar events happening with different players during different times of the year. I had some league ideas though. My first idea was under 6 foot NBA. It's kind of stupid and definetly won't be happening but it would be interesting to watch. Plus it gives so many opportunities to people who didn't have a big growth spurt. You can even lower the rim to 9 feet. My second league idea is the triple threat tournament for NBA players. Basically first to 100 3x3 games and it could be somewhat like a playoff but with no ring obviously. And player-picked teams kind of like all-stars.,t5_2qo4s,639,115,2 interesting NBA league ideas (random thoughts)We have NBA Games and NBA Summer League games.

Can the Warriors win one more championship or is the run finally over?,nba,"Even with Draymond coming back this feels like a different era for the Warriors. With Meyer’s gone, Jerry West gone only Steve Kerr remains. Remember it was the combo of the basketball genius of Meyers/West/Kerr that constructed the Warriors dynasty. 

I don’t see bringing in Chris Paul as a move Meyers/West/Kerr would make. He’s clearly on the downside. It feels like a desperation move based on not having a bunch of cap money. Getting rid of Jordan Poole seems more like they were appeasing Draymond to increase his chances of coming back.

I don’t know if Chris Paul in his prime would gell with the Big 3 and now this new “big 4” is all on the downside. Especially CP3/Klay. I don’t know if Curry and Draymond have enough left on the tank to carry the roster. Looney is nice player but I don’t see them having the young legs to offset the age of the core.

The value of the Heat package for Dame,nba,"Shams recently said the framework of the Heat package is:

3-4 1sts

Pick Swaps

2nd round Picks

Herro to a third team

expiring contracts

young player(s) ( JJJ and Jovic)

I am obviously biased as a Heat fan, but is this not a good package?

KD went for 4 1sts, and 3 young players including Mikal Bridges who is a great piece. Herro is obviously not on Bridges level, but he is still a very good young player that doesn't fit the Blazers current timeline/roster so it makes sense that he goes to a 3rd team to give more picks to the Blazers. I think collectively we can agree he is in a different tier from Dame, so it makes sense that the value for his trade would be less.

How are the suns picks better than the Heat's? Are the Suns expected to be terrible in the next 3-5 years? I wouldn't think so, and the same could be said for Miami. So shouldn't those picks have similar value? What makes the Heat's picks so terrible  compared to other contenders?

Maybe someone has a better explanation for me but it does seem that the trade value for this package is being extremely underrated.

"Best FIBA commercial ever - Manu Ginobili ""The Dove""",nba,"This is in my opinion the best international basketball commercial ever. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXOAZJvEEXA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXOAZJvEEXA)

A little bit of context: in the 2002 Indiana World Cup, after beating the United States for the first time, Argentina lost the final against Yugoslavia with some really controversial calls at the end of the game, which knocked Argentina down. Manu was unable to play due to injury.

But the revenge came soon: in the 2004 Olympic Games. Argentina's first game was against Serbia, former Yugoslavia. A very tense and close game, in which Serbia went ahead 82-81 with 3.8 seconds left on the clock. Then came the most iconic shot in the history of Argentine basketball and perhaps of Manu's career. The beginning of the path that led Argentina to win the gold.

This commercial imagines in a very funny way the coach's talk just before the play (in the real game there was no timeout). 

Here is a translation:

**Coach:**  We are against the ropes! There are three seconds left to turn it around. Leo, give the ball to Puma on the left side. Puma, attack the number 4 that's made of wood, give him a spin, and when there are 0.6 seconds left, there you throw it to Manu who is coming through the middle with a guy on top of him.

Manu, you get the easy part! You receive, you dive like a dove, and in the air, with two tenths of a second left, you score and we win. Okey? There we all go, we throw ourselves on top of him, they want to kill themselves, people celebrate like crazy...

Come on, it's not difficult, man, hey, listen to me, we can do it!

**Reporter (real transmission):** ...and Argentina goes for the miracle. The Puma takes it, he makes a detoooour, pay attention... It's the last chance Argentina has! Ginobili with a doooooooooove. ARGENTINAAAAAAAA! From which nest did you come out dove of peace? I saw you fly!

Clarification On Trading Min Contracts With The New CBA,nba,"I'm just trying to get some clarity on the trading of min contracts. Here are the rules as I understand them:

1. Can't aggregate multiple min players together in a trade, (doesn't apply if the amount of contracts, not necessarily salary, incoming/outgoing are the same?)
2. Rule #1 doesn't apply if you are only trading min players, in which case you can trade 2 min players, (again doesn't apply if the amount of contracts, not necessarily salary, incoming/outgoing are the same?)
3. Neither Rule 1 nor Rule 2 apply between December 15th and the trade deadline, at which point you can trade as many as you want

Why have rules 1+2 if you are going to have rule 3? Why have rule 3 if you are going to have rules 1+2? Seems unnecessarily complicated. Am I reading this right?

In deals outside that period, if a team is aggregating two or more salaries in a trade and getting at least one player back, and the number of contracts that team is sending out is more than the amount of players it is receiving in return, then that team cannot trade more than one minimum contract.

"Was the impact of handchecking ""real""? On the flipside, is it even really gone now?",nba,"People have always talked about how much harder it is back in the day because it was exponentially more physical, mainly due to the handchecking. Since I'm a Gen Z AND a super casual fan, my knowledge is obviously close to zero on this. However, I did try my best during my free time to watch some full 90's games on YouTube and other stuff, which isn't honestly that much since I've probably only seen like 15 so far. And no, I started gaining an interest in watching 90's ball before I tried to look for the handchecking things. Anyway, from what these old heads and former players say, they make it seem like the defenders were on the offensive player's jersey every time they're on-ball but I don't really see much beyond ""normal"" basketball? By normal I mean that the greater, if any, honestly, possession-by-possession physicality, especially the handchecking, isn't really that noticeable? Like when when Jordan hit the shot vs the Jazz, it wasn't really until he started making his move toward the defender did the latter only even touch MJ. With what I've heard, I expected something more like the defender being in Jordan's face with a few shoves here and there, but no, not really. I know that's only one example but that's like the highest stake possible, no? Another observation is that when they did handcheck the offensive player just kinda ""handshakes"" it a lot of the time by like doing backdown dribbles and shit. 

Yes, I did only watch 15 or so games, but a lot of those are playoff games and I honestly expected more.

[O.C.] Who would have won Finals MVPs before 1969?,nba,"Possible someone has already done this here but I did a quick search &amp; couldn't find anything. I've always felt like the lack of Finals MVPs puts early players at a disadvantage when it comes to legacy conversation &amp; wanted to give them their due.

**1947 Philadelphia Warriors - Joe Fulks** We mostly only have PPG to go off of before 1955. Efficiency was very low across the league at this point but even by that standard the hall of famer Fulks was a massive shot chucker, going 4-20, 8-25 and 10-34 in games 2, 4 and 5. Fulks averaged 26.2 PPG while his second leading scorer averaged 11.4 so this really wasn't close.

**1948 Baltimore Bullets - Connie Simmons** How many of you NBA history buffs knew who Connie Simmons is? He never won any accolades while averaging 9.8 PPG for his career but the Bullets winning this series was a complete team effort &amp; Simmons was their best player, stepping up his play to put up 15.2 PPG on good efficiency for the time, while also finishing second in assists on his team. Guarantee he's the only Simmons who will ever have a Finals MVP

**1949 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** The league's first true superstar was in a class of his own at this point. Unfortunately we don't have shooting splits for every game but in two of three we do have Mikan went 14-21 and 13-20 which is out of this world for the time. He easily led both teams with 27.5 PPG and he's Mikan so he was probably averaging like 15 rebounds as well

**1950 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** Mikan upped his scoring to 32.2 this series while his team averaged just 84.5 putting this on the level of Jordan 1998. His efficiency did seem to drop off from 1949 outside of a brilliant 40 piece in game 6 but there's no doubt he was completely unstoppable

**1951 Rochester Royals - Arnie Risen** Congrats Kings fans, your team's best Finals player finally gets some recognition. They almost blew the series after going up 3-0 but the Royal's hall of fame big man was too much to overcome as he finished with averages of 21.7, 14.3 and 2.7

**1952 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** Mikan was no longer the scoring phenom of years past but he was still a fantastic all-around player putting up averages of 21.7, 17.4 and 2.4

**1953 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** For some reason they stopped tracking rebounds this series. All I know is that Mikan had 19 in game 4 but it's fairly safe to assume he was averaging his usual 15+. He also led his team in scoring once again with an inefficient 20.8 making this another easy choice.

**1954 Minneapolis Lakers - George Mikan** The last of Mikan's 5 finals MVPs as he averaged 18.1 PPG, the only member of his team to get above 11. He added 13.1 rebounds per game for good measure. Man I wish we had more footage of this guy

**1955 Syracuse Nationals - Dolph Schayes** Led his team in both scoring and efficiency with totals of 19, 11.9 and 3. Not sure how it's possible to lead your team in efficiency shooting 39% but nevertheless he did it making him the easy choice

**1956 Philadelphia Warriors - Paul Arizin** ""Pitchin' Paul"" is one of the few players of his time who would maybe still be good nowadays as his statline of 27.6, 8 &amp; 2.8 on 43% from the field and 88% from the free throw line is still respectable. He had a wonky shooting form for sure but for the 1950's it was the smoothest jumper in the game.

**1957 Boston Celtics - Tom Heinsohn** To the surprise of absolutely nobody the legendary hall of famer who spent his entire career in Boston won Finals MVP in his rookie season, but maybe not the player you were expecting. Heinsohn averaged 24, 12.6 &amp; 2.1 on 40% shooting while Bob Cousy put up 20.7, 6.7 &amp; 9.1 on 32% shooting. You could go either way on this but at this point efficiency was rising and 32% was really ugly. Heinsohn also had one of the greatest game 7's in history putting up 37 and 23 on phenomenal efficiency while Cousy shot 2/20 yikes

**1958 Atlanta Hawks - Bob Pettit** You could make the case that Cliff Hagan was the Hawks' best player in the playoffs as a whole but for the finals Pettit stepped up when the team needed him putting up averages of 29.3, 17 &amp; 2.2 outpacing Hagan's 25.2, 9.7 &amp; 3.5. Like with the previous series the deciding game 6 was a major factor in determining this award and in that game Bob Pettit dropped 50 points and 19 rebounds, in a game the Hawks won by just 1.

**1959 Boston Celtics - Tom Heinsohn** Bill Russell set the all time record for rebounds per game in a finals series averaging a jaw-dropping 29.5 but at the end of the day you need to score the ball to win &amp; I just can't give Finals MVP to a guy who averaged a very inefficient 9.3 points per game. Once again Heinsohn was the team's best option as he led the team in both points and efficiency, putting up 24.3 on 48% shooting while pitching in a well-rounded 8.8 rebounds and 3 assists. When discussing all time greats from the early NBA nobody ever talks about Tom Heinsohn's legacy but I bet they would if he had 2 finals MVPs.

**1960 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** We're now getting into Russell's prime as he had developed into a solid offense player while still being the GOAT defender. For this series he averaged 16.7, 24.9 and 3 on solid efficiency and in typical Russell fashion he entered another level in game 7 putting up 22 points and 35 rebounds

**1961 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** Take the stats of the last series and pump them up a notch. Russell averaged 17.6, 28.8 and 4.4 although his efficiency dipped a bit. There is a case to be made for a late-career Finals MVP for Bob Cousy, who averaged 19.8, 5 &amp; 10.6 on about the same efficiency once you take free throws into account. However defensively Bill Russell is Bill Russell while Cousy was 32 at this point. 

**1962 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** One of the greatest finals series of all time. Russell averaged 22.9, 27 &amp; 5.7 on excellent efficiency while coming up huge in game 7 where he put up 30 points and 40 rebounds in a 3 point game. Were it not for that game I'd have to seriously consider the Lakers' Elgin Baylor who averaged 40.6, 17.9 &amp; 3.7 but Russell's game 7 makes this a no contest.

**1963 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** A step down from 1962 (duh), he still averaged 20, 26 &amp; 5.3 on good efficiency. 

**1964 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** This is the hardest choice of all of these. Russell had a down finals by his legendary standard averaging 11.2, 25.2 &amp; 5 while teammate Sam Jones put up an efficient 21.2, 4.4 &amp; 2.8. Jones was never known to be an elite defender but of course we don't have much footage of this series so I can't say for sure how much of a factor this was. Russell has the most well-rounded stats &amp; he played 10 more minutes per game than Jones so I want to say he'd get the award but 10 extra PPG on better efficiency is important. It's a tough call. 

**1965 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** So Bill Russell decided to shoot 70% from the field in this series. What a fascinating guy he was. You almost feel bad for the Lakers like what were they supposed to do about this? In total he averaged 17.8, 25 &amp; 5.8

**1966 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** Russell continued his high level of performance in this series averaging 23.6, 24.3 &amp; 3.7 on well over 50% shooting while coming up with 25 points and 32 rebounds in the 2-point game 7. This series puts him at 7 Finals MVPs to pass Jordan. Are we sure this guy isn't the GOAT? Wherever you rank him, his ability to come through in big moments is the biggest reason for his 11 championships and that's a quality you can't underestimate

**1967 Philadelphia 76ers - Wilt Chamberlain** We've finally reached Wilt, who had put up crazy statlines in losing efforts throughout the decade but he was only his team's 5th leading scorer this time. Still, 17.7, 28.5 &amp; 6.8 is a Finals MVP statline &amp; of the Sixers 5 17 PPG scorers he was easily the most efficient. Also it's Wilt so you know he was averaging like 9 BPG

**1968 Boston Celtics - John Havlicek** You could maybe go with Bill Russell yet again as he had a characteristic statline of 17.3, 21.8 &amp; 5.7 but unlike Sam Jones from 1964 Havlicek was another elite all around player so I have Russell losing this one off the difference in scoring. Hondo averaged 27.3, 8.7 &amp; 6.7 on similar efficiency while both players played averaged over 48 minutes per game on the series.

**1958 Atlanta Hawks - Bob Pettit** You could make the case that Cliff Hagan was the Hawks' best player in the playoffs as a whole but for the finals Pettit stepped up when the team needed him putting up averages of 29.3, 17 &amp; 2.2 outpacing Hagan's 25.2, 9.7 &amp; 3.5. Like with the previous series the deciding game 6 was a major factor in determining this award and in that game Bob Pettit dropped 50 points and 19 rebounds, in a game the Hawks won by just 1.

**1959 Boston Celtics - Tom Heinsohn** Bill Russell set the all time record for rebounds per game in a finals series averaging a jaw-dropping 29.5 but at the end of the day you need to score the ball to win &amp; I just can't give Finals MVP to a guy who averaged a very inefficient 9.3 points per game. Once again Heinsohn was the team's best option as he led the team in both points and efficiency, putting up 24.3 on 48% shooting while pitching in a well-rounded 8.8 rebounds and 3 assists. When discussing all time greats from the early NBA nobody ever talks about Tom Heinsohn's legacy but I bet they would if he had 2 finals MVPs.

**1960 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** We're now getting into Russell's prime as he had developed into a solid offense player while still being the GOAT defender. For this series he averaged 16.7, 24.9 and 3 on solid efficiency and in typical Russell fashion he entered another level in game 7 putting up 22 points and 35 rebounds

**1961 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** Take the stats of the last series and pump them up a notch. Russell averaged 17.6, 28.8 and 4.4 although his efficiency dipped a bit. There is a case to be made for a late-career Finals MVP for Bob Cousy, who averaged 19.8, 5 &amp; 10.6 on about the same efficiency once you take free throws into account. However defensively Bill Russell is Bill Russell while Cousy was 32 at this point. 

**1962 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** One of the greatest finals series of all time. Russell averaged 22.9, 27 &amp; 5.7 on excellent efficiency while coming up huge in game 7 where he put up 30 points and 40 rebounds in a 3 point game. Were it not for that game I'd have to seriously consider the Lakers' Elgin Baylor who averaged 40.6, 17.9 &amp; 3.7 but Russell's game 7 makes this a no contest.

**1963 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** A step down from 1962 (duh), he still averaged 20, 26 &amp; 5.3 on good efficiency. 

**1964 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** This is the hardest choice of all of these. Russell had a down finals by his legendary standard averaging 11.2, 25.2 &amp; 5 while teammate Sam Jones put up an efficient 21.2, 4.4 &amp; 2.8. Jones was never known to be an elite defender but of course we don't have much footage of this series so I can't say for sure how much of a factor this was. Russell has the most well-rounded stats &amp; he played 10 more minutes per game than Jones so I want to say he'd get the award but 10 extra PPG on better efficiency is important. It's a tough call. 

**1965 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** So Bill Russell decided to shoot 70% from the field in this series. What a fascinating guy he was. You almost feel bad for the Lakers like what were they supposed to do about this? In total he averaged 17.8, 25 &amp; 5.8

**1966 Boston Celtics - Bill Russell** Russell continued his high level of performance in this series averaging 23.6, 24.3 &amp; 3.7 on well over 50% shooting while coming up with 25 points and 32 rebounds in the 2-point game 7. This series puts him at 7 Finals MVPs to pass Jordan. Are we sure this guy isn't the GOAT? Wherever you rank him, his ability to come through in big moments is the biggest reason for his 11 championships and that's a quality you can't underestimate

**1967 Philadelphia 76ers - Wilt Chamberlain** We've finally reached Wilt, who had put up crazy statlines in losing efforts throughout the decade but he was only his team's 5th leading scorer this time. Still, 17.7, 28.5 &amp; 6.8 is a Finals MVP statline &amp; of the Sixers 5 17 PPG scorers he was easily the most efficient. Also it's Wilt so you know he was averaging like 9 BPG

**1968 Boston Celtics - John Havlicek** You could maybe go with Bill Russell yet again as he had a characteristic statline of 17.3, 21.8 &amp; 5.7 but unlike Sam Jones from 1964 Havlicek was another elite all around player so I have Russell losing this one off the difference in scoring. Hondo averaged 27.3, 8.7 &amp; 6.7 on similar efficiency while both players played averaged over 48 minutes per game on the series.

What's your key NBA memory?,nba,"I was once at a Blazer game with my dad when I was really young. He would get really good tickets from his clients every once in awhile and I remember sitting close enough to the Blazers bench and I could see my favorite player of all time, Damon Stoudamire standing near the scorer's table (they were warming up still). My dad and I started yelling his name to get his attention but it was too loud in the stadium. Some folks sitting next to us noticed this and started to yell along with us. We eventually got Damon's attention and he turned around and gave us/me a headnod and a thumbs up. I'll never forget that moment. 

Right after that, a guy sitting next to us saw my excitement and claimed he had Patrick Ewing's (I think?) used armband from a game where he threw it at the crowd. He brought it out and let me see it. He then told me I could keep it. I couldn't believe it. 

Looking back on it, that's one of the best days of my life. I was maybe 8 or 9 and it was at an NBA basketball game with my dad. This is before tip-off. I think that's the magic behind sports and being a fan of the game. It's so much more than just basketball. It's the shared experience with the people we care about.

Lakers believe Lonzo Ball's injuries were caused by his signature shoes,nba,"The Chicago Bulls personnel privately believe Lonzo Ball might never play in the NBA again. And Ball's first team, the Los Angeles Lakers, has a theory as to the root cause of all his injuries.

Ball has experienced lingering leg and ankle problems since the start of his career. The worst came when he had to miss the entirety of the 2022-2023 season. In addition, he's only played in more than 60 games a season once in his six-year career. At the young age of 25, he's already had to undergo three different knee surgeries. It once got so bad, Ball's knee soreness made it hard for him to walk up the stairs.

The Lakers believe all the wear and tear on his knees was caused by one thing: His Big Baller Brand signature sneakers (Zo2).


In an article by ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Paula Lavigne in 2019, Ball confirmed the Lakers were concerned about his shoes. All he told them was he'd be willing to do “just minor things” to adjust his sneakers if necessary.

Fox Sports radio host Doug Gottlieb also tweeted last May 2023, that the Lakers always believed his injuries were caused by the shoes:

Team 3: Jokic, Giannis, Magic, Jordan, Dirk

Team 4: Karl Malone, Bird, Curry, Wade, Hakeem

While it’s from a Facebook shitpost, I do think they are interesting teams each with clear strengths and weaknesses. Further down are my high thoughts, would love to hear y’all’s.

Of course I think 1 is the best but here are my thoughts why:

Team 1: Very well constructed, excellent spacing (having a 4 in KG who can shoot the 3 I think is big with these hypothetical teams composed of players from all eras). Peak defense for all of those players is strong, one of the most talented teams overall imo.

Team 2: loses a lot of points due to fit and the defensive liability of AI and Stockton (while I think it would be good enough against most real teams, these hypothetical ones are a different story). Has the most top end talent with 3 Top 10 players all time, the spacing could be very rough - who knows though, with prime Shaq it may not matter

Team 3: very high offensive potential with this lineup (I probably underrated it above), interior D would be the question with this team. Could some combo of Giannis, Dirk, and Jokic handle prime Shaq, Hakeem, Kareem, Malone, etc

Team 4: least top end talent with imo bird being their best player but solid talent throughout. Wade would be the weak link for this team, him and curry could be defensive liabilities against some of the bigger teams. This one is weird where it has spacing (curry exists) but doesn’t with no front court without range.

Putting an asterisk on every NBA championship,nba,"2023 - Jayson Tatum got injured at the beginning of ECF game 7. Jaylen Brown continues to struggle dribbling with his left hand. Giannis Antetokounmpo, one of the two best players in the league, got injured early in Game 1 against Miami, leaving Milwaukee, the best team in the league, without their star player.

2022 - Jayson Tatum choked massively in the NBA Finals and Jaylen Brown struggles to dribble with his left hand. Milwaukee’s Khris Middleton also got injured in the ECSF against Boston, yet they still pushed the series to 7 games.

2021 - Kevin Durant’s toe and LA Lakers were w/o LeBron or AD.

2020 - Bubble.

2019 - Kevin Durant only played 11 minutes all series and Klay was out for 1.5 games. Plus, Kawhi was unimaginably lucky in the ECSF.

2018 - Best team of all time. Chris Paul suffered a hamstring injury in Game 6 of the WCF.

2017 - Best team of all time.

2016 - Draymond Green was suspended in game 5 of the NBA Finals.

2015 - Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injuries, on top of other injuries CLE was suffering.

2014 - San Antonio’s AC causes LeBron to cramp in game 1.

2013 - OKC traded Harden and lost Westbrook to injury in the playoffs.

2012 - Lockout season, many injuries throughout the league.

2011 - LeBron forgot how to play basketball.

2010 - In game 7 of the NBA Finals, LA took 21 4th quarter free throws, while Boston took 16 all game.

2009 - LA didn’t have to play against LeBron, who averaged 39-8-8 in the ECF. Kobe’s lowest win percentage is against LeBron.

2008 - Kevin McHale *(Celtics legend, then Minnesota Timberwolves GM)* traded Kevin Garnett to Boston. Without KG, Boston doesn’t win in 2008.

2007 - Phoenix’s Boris Diaw and Amare Stoudemire were suspended in game 5 of the WCSF.

2006 - Miami took 52 more FTs in this series than Dallas.

2005 - League expansion. Rasheed Wallace left Robert Horry open for an easy 3.

2004 - LA’s Malone (18 ppg) was injured (knee).

2003 - Dirk didn’t play in the last 3 games of the WCF because of a knee injury.

2002 - The refs gave LA an absurd 27 free throws in game 6 of the WCF.

2001 - LA lost both games to the Milwaukee Bucks, and Ray Allen has all but said that the MIL-PHI ECF was rigged so the Finals could be LAL-PHI.

2000 - LA would have lost in WCF if Portland didn’t shoot 5/23 in 4th Quarter of game 7 and blow a 15-point lead.

1999 - Lockout season.

1998 - Utah choked again in 4th Quarter of game 2. Plus, in game 6, an obvious 3-pointer by Utah’s Howard Isley was incorrectly waved off, and a later 3 by Chicago’s Ron Harper was incorrectly counted.

1997 - Utah choked in the 4th Quarter of games 5 and 6, shooting 5/32. Plus, the 3PT line was shortened.

1996 - NBA added more expansion teams, watering down Jordan’s competition. 2-time all-defense Nate McMillan’s back was in bad shape in the Finals, so he didn’t play very much. Gary Payton was not guarding Michael Jordan until the series was already 3-0 CHI. After Payton was put on MJ, Seattle went 2-1.

1995 - Michael Jordan came back late in the year, but wasn’t back to his normal self, so Houston was able to face a young and inexperienced Orlando team. Nick Anderson also missed 4 straight free throws in game 1, and if he’d made these, Orlando would have won.

1994 - Michael Jordan, the best player in the world, was off being a shit baseball player.

1993 - Chicago was able to face an offensively challenged Knicks team in the ECF and a defensively challenged Suns team in the NBA Finals. 

1992 - Arvydas Sabonis was in his prime playing overseas, and Chicago’s biggest weakness by far was the center, which Sabonis would have exploited heavily.

1991 - LA’s top scorer James Worthy and top shooter Byron Scott were both injured and couldn’t play in Game 5.

1990 - Arvydas Sabonis wasn’t playing in America yet, so Detroit didn’t have to face him when they played Portland.

1989 - Magic injured his hamstring in game 3 of the Finals, sidelining him from the rest of the series.

1988 - Isiah Thomas suffered a major ankle injury, costing him almost all of his minutes in game 7. Also, Lambier was called for a nonexistent foul on Kareem in game 6, allowing LA to extend the series to 7 games.

1987 - LA faced a horribly injured Celtics team. Plus, Len Bias was dead, and his youth would have allowed them to rest Bird more, giving them more counters to James Worthy.

1986 - Boston didn’t have to face the 62 win Los Angeles Lakers and instead had to face the young and inexperienced Houston Rockets.


1985 - Boston’s Cedric Maxwell (1981 FMVP) missed 21 games in 1985 due to knee surgery and was a shell of himself upon his return.

1984 - Lakers HOF forward Jamaal Wilkes (17 ppg) missed the 1st round with a gastrointestinal virus, which caused him to lose his starting spot and become a nonfactor. Despite this, Boston barely won in 7.

1983 - Instead of winning 4 playoff series, the 76ers only had to win 3. Plus, James Worthy got injured in the Finals.

1982 - The top 2 seeds had a bye in the first round. Obviously the fresher #1 seeded Lakers, who played 8 games pre-finals, beet the 76ers, who had played 15.

1981 - Boston faced a losing team in the Finals (40-40 Rockets)

1980 - In a trade a few years prior, Los Angeles was able to take Magic Johnson #1 overall and add him to a 47-35 team. They also won a coin flip over Chicago to get the #1 pick.

1979 - Two of the Bullets’ starters got injuries in Game 5 of the NBA Finals

1978 - Bill Walton (reigning MVP) broke his foot in Feb., Washington didn’t have to face the best team in the league

1977 - Ref strike

1950-1976 - Pre-merger

2021 - Kevin Durant’s toe and LA Lakers were w/o LeBron or AD.

2020 - Bubble.

2019 - Kevin Durant only played 11 minutes all series and Klay was out for 1.5 games. Plus, Kawhi was unimaginably lucky in the ECSF.

2018 - Best team of all time. Chris Paul suffered a hamstring injury in Game 6 of the WCF.

2017 - Best team of all time.

2016 - Draymond Green was suspended in game 5 of the NBA Finals.

2015 - Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injuries, on top of other injuries CLE was suffering.

2014 - San Antonio’s AC causes LeBron to cramp in game 1.

2013 - OKC traded Harden and lost Westbrook to injury in the playoffs.

2012 - Lockout season, many injuries throughout the league.

2011 - LeBron forgot how to play basketball.

2010 - In game 7 of the NBA Finals, LA took 21 4th quarter free throws, while Boston took 16 all game.

2009 - LA didn’t have to play against LeBron, who averaged 39-8-8 in the ECF. Kobe’s lowest win percentage is against LeBron.

2008 - Kevin McHale *(Celtics legend, then Minnesota Timberwolves GM)* traded Kevin Garnett to Boston. Without KG, Boston doesn’t win in 2008.

2007 - Phoenix’s Boris Diaw and Amare Stoudemire were suspended in game 5 of the WCSF.

2006 - Miami took 52 more FTs in this series than Dallas.

2005 - League expansion. Rasheed Wallace left Robert Horry open for an easy 3.

2004 - LA’s Malone (18 ppg) was injured (knee).

2003 - Dirk didn’t play in the last 3 games of the WCF because of a knee injury.

2002 - The refs gave LA an absurd 27 free throws in game 6 of the WCF.

2001 - LA lost both games to the Milwaukee Bucks, and Ray Allen has all but said that the MIL-PHI ECF was rigged so the Finals could be LAL-PHI.

2000 - LA would have lost in WCF if Portland didn’t shoot 5/23 in 4th Quarter of game 7 and blow a 15-point lead.

1999 - Lockout season.

1998 - Utah choked again in 4th Quarter of game 2. Plus, in game 6, an obvious 3-pointer by Utah’s Howard Isley was incorrectly waved off, and a later 3 by Chicago’s Ron Harper was incorrectly counted.

1997 - Utah choked in the 4th Quarter of games 5 and 6, shooting 5/32. Plus, the 3PT line was shortened.

1996 - NBA added more expansion teams, watering down Jordan’s competition. 2-time all-defense Nate McMillan’s back was in bad shape in the Finals, so he didn’t play very much. Gary Payton was not guarding Michael Jordan until the series was already 3-0 CHI. After Payton was put on MJ, Seattle went 2-1.

1995 - Michael Jordan came back late in the year, but wasn’t back to his normal self, so Houston was able to face a young and inexperienced Orlando team. Nick Anderson also missed 4 straight free throws in game 1, and if he’d made these, Orlando would have won.

1994 - Michael Jordan, the best player in the world, was off being a shit baseball player.

1993 - Chicago was able to face an offensively challenged Knicks team in the ECF and a defensively challenged Suns team in the NBA Finals. 

1992 - Arvydas Sabonis was in his prime playing overseas, and Chicago’s biggest weakness by far was the center, which Sabonis would have exploited heavily.

1991 - LA’s top scorer James Worthy and top shooter Byron Scott were both injured and couldn’t play in Game 5.

1990 - Arvydas Sabonis wasn’t playing in America yet, so Detroit didn’t have to face him when they played Portland.

1989 - Magic injured his hamstring in game 3 of the Finals, sidelining him from the rest of the series.

1988 - Isiah Thomas suffered a major ankle injury, costing him almost all of his minutes in game 7. Also, Lambier was called for a nonexistent foul on Kareem in game 6, allowing LA to extend the series to 7 games.

1987 - LA faced a horribly injured Celtics team. Plus, Len Bias was dead, and his youth would have allowed them to rest Bird more, giving them more counters to James Worthy.

1986 - Boston didn’t have to face the 62 win Los Angeles Lakers and instead had to face the young and inexperienced Houston Rockets.


1985 - Boston’s Cedric Maxwell (1981 FMVP) missed 21 games in 1985 due to knee surgery and was a shell of himself upon his return.

1984 - Lakers HOF forward Jamaal Wilkes (17 ppg) missed the 1st round with a gastrointestinal virus, which caused him to lose his starting spot and become a nonfactor. Despite this, Boston barely won in 7.

1983 - Instead of winning 4 playoff series, the 76ers only had to win 3. Plus, James Worthy got injured in the Finals.

1982 - The top 2 seeds had a bye in the first round. Obviously the fresher #1 seeded Lakers, who played 8 games pre-finals, beet the 76ers, who had played 15.

1981 - Boston faced a losing team in the Finals (40-40 Rockets)

1980 - In a trade a few years prior, Los Angeles was able to take Magic Johnson #1 overall and add him to a 47-35 team. They also won a coin flip over Chicago to get the #1 pick.

1979 - Two of the Bullets’ starters got injuries in Game 5 of the NBA Finals

1978 - Bill Walton (reigning MVP) broke his foot in Feb., Washington didn’t have to face the best team in the league

1977 - Ref strike

1950-1976 - Pre-merger

Kyrie acting up.,nba,,t5_2qo4s,0,1,Kyrie acting up.
Replacement Tags for the NBA In-Season Tournament,nba,"One of the biggest questions about the In-Season Tournament proposed for next season was how to make the reward worth it for both the players and the teams. To me, it seems like this is the NBA's attempt to introduce a competition like the FA Cup in English soccer/football - a competition of smaller but still relevant importance that runs concurrently to the league itself. But this ignores part of the reason the FA Cup matters for English teams and fans.

The FA Cup holds prestige because of its history, and also because of the opportunity for smaller teams further down the English football pyramid to upset larger teams. In practice, English Premier League teams almost always win. However, due to the higher variance of soccer compared to basketball, the possibility of smaller teams upsetting larger teams always looms in the background. The fact that European soccer leagues use the point table system rather than the playoff system also helps increase the importance of cup competitions, since there is more of a separation between the competition ""types"".

So in order to mimic the effect of the FA Cup, the NBA would have to introduce teams that normally don't compete in the NBA. This could mean either foreign teams, NCAA teams, or G-League teams. However, this idea wouldn't work due to a combination of logistics, the large talent gap, and relatively low variance in basketball compared to other sports. As a result, these games would largely be meaningless, since the NBA teams likely roll over the foreign teams (assuming they play their best players and don't just play bench players).

So how to make the players and teams care? I'd like to propose the idea of replacement tags. 

One of the biggest intangibles about the playoffs is the health of the teams involved. This past year, injuries changed the trajectory of multiple playoff series. So what if the winner of the NBA Cup retained the right to replace an injured player in the playoffs? Some rules for the sake of balance:

1. Teams would only be able to use players that weren't already in the playoffs. So teams wouldn't be able to ""steal"" players from eliminated teams, only teams that didn't make the post-season in the first place.

2. Only the team that wins the NBA Cup that season gets a replacement tag. Some food for thought - do replacement tags stack? So can, for example, the Thunder win three consecutive replacement tags, then trade them for even more draft picks? Or alternatively, can the Clippers hoard multiple tags and replace both Kawhi and Paul George at the same time when they both get injured? Or do the replacement tags only apply once, to the current year's playoffs?

3. The value of the player's salary for the year would have to be less than or equal to the value of the salary being replaced. So for instance, when Herro ($5.7 million) went down, the Heat could have replaced him with somebody like Franz Wagner ($5.25 million) or Tyrese Haliburton ($4.2 million), but not someone like Paolo Banchero ($11.1 million). However, once Oladipo ($8.75 million) got hurt, then the Heat could have replaced him with someone like LaMelo ($8.6 million), or Scottie Barnes ($7.6 million).

The caveat here is that the player being replaced cannot be subbed back in. So if Herro could have played in the Finals, as was being suggested at the time, do the Heat replace him right away, or gamble on his health? 

What issues does this introduce to the team, if the player has a chance to come back, but the team replaces him anyways? 

Hypothetically, do the Heat replace Herro/Oladipo immediately, or do they hold out in case someone with a larger contract gets hurt later? 

If a player on a large contract plays consistently poorly, like Kyle Lowry, does Riley put a bullet in his kneecap to take advantage of his $28.3 million contract? This would open up a slot for DeRozan ($27.3 million) or someone to help with size, like Nikola Vucevic ($22 million) or Lauri Markannen ($16.48 million).

I believe replacement tags benefit both the team doing the ""stealing"", and the team getting its player stolen. A younger player out of the playoffs gets some playoff reps, while obviously the team doing the stealing gets a replacement for an injured player. The ""lending"" team couldn't refuse as long as the player wanted to go, and that player would qualify for a ring as well. 

So what do you all think? It would certainly introduce some gamesmanship to the playoffs if an NBA Cup winner was in it. Some other examples:

1. When Kawhi ($42.5 million) went down, the Clippers could have replaced him with Luka ($37 million), Kyrie ($38.9 million), Zach Lavine ($37 million), Brandon Ingram ($31.65 million) or Gordon Hayward ($30.1 million). All fine players.
2. Since John Wall ($47.3 million) went into the playoffs injured, the Clippers could have replaced him from day one with Bradley Beal ($43.3 million) or Damian Lillard ($42.5 million). Or any of the players above, for that matter.
3. When Chris Paul ($28.4 million) went down, the Suns could have replaced him with DeRozan ($27.3 million), Anfernee Simons ($22.3 million), or Fred VanVleet ($21.25 million). In this example, if the player coming in gets a ring, does that mean the player getting subbed out loses his? CP3 finally being on a championship winning team, getting injured, and not getting a ring as a result would certainly be a very CP3-style turn of events.

What do you guys think? I think it would be a great incentive to care about the NBA cup, since it has the potential to directly affect a team's chances of winning the title.",t5_2qo4s,5605,949,"Replacement Tags for the NBA In-Season TournamentOne of the biggest questions about the In-Season Tournament proposed for next season was how to make the reward worth it for both the players and the teams. To me, it seems like this is the NBA's attempt to introduce a competition like the FA Cup in English soccer/football - a competition of smaller but still relevant importance that runs concurrently to the league itself. But this ignores part of the reason the FA Cup matters for English teams and fans.

The FA Cup holds prestige because of its history, and also because of the opportunity for smaller teams further down the English football pyramid to upset larger teams. In practice, English Premier League teams almost always win. However, due to the higher variance of soccer compared to basketball, the possibility of smaller teams upsetting larger teams always looms in the background. The fact that European soccer leagues use the point table system rather than the playoff system also helps increase the importance of cup competitions, since there is more of a separation between the competition ""types"".

So in order to mimic the effect of the FA Cup, the NBA would have to introduce teams that normally don't compete in the NBA. This could mean either foreign teams, NCAA teams, or G-League teams. However, this idea wouldn't work due to a combination of logistics, the large talent gap, and relatively low variance in basketball compared to other sports. As a result, these games would largely be meaningless, since the NBA teams likely roll over the foreign teams (assuming they play their best players and don't just play bench players).

So how to make the players and teams care? I'd like to propose the idea of replacement tags. 

One of the biggest intangibles about the playoffs is the health of the teams involved. This past year, injuries changed the trajectory of multiple playoff series. So what if the winner of the NBA Cup retained the right to replace an injured player in the playoffs? Some rules for the sake of balance:

1. Teams would only be able to use players that weren't already in the playoffs. So teams wouldn't be able to ""steal"" players from eliminated teams, only teams that didn't make the post-season in the first place.

2. Only the team that wins the NBA Cup that season gets a replacement tag. Some food for thought - do replacement tags stack? So can, for example, the Thunder win three consecutive replacement tags, then trade them for even more draft picks? Or alternatively, can the Clippers hoard multiple tags and replace both Kawhi and Paul George at the same time when they both get injured? Or do the replacement tags only apply once, to the current year's playoffs?

3. The value of the player's salary for the year would have to be less than or equal to the value of the salary being replaced. So for instance, when Herro ($5.7 million) went down, the Heat could have replaced him with somebody like Franz Wagner ($5.25 million) or Tyrese Haliburton ($4.2 million), but not someone like Paolo Banchero ($11.1 million). However, once Oladipo ($8.75 million) got hurt, then the Heat could have replaced him with someone like LaMelo ($8.6 million), or Scottie Barnes ($7.6 million).

The caveat here is that the player being replaced cannot be subbed back in. So if Herro could have played in the Finals, as was being suggested at the time, do the Heat replace him right away, or gamble on his health? 

What issues does this introduce to the team, if the player has a chance to come back, but the team replaces him anyways? 

Hypothetically, do the Heat replace Herro/Oladipo immediately, or do they hold out in case someone with a larger contract gets hurt later? 

If a player on a large contract plays consistently poorly, like Kyle Lowry, does Riley put a bullet in his kneecap to take advantage of his $28.3 million contract? This would open up a slot for DeRozan ($27.3 million) or someone to help with size, like Nikola Vucevic ($22 million) or Lauri Markannen ($16.48 million).

Guideline to the 2023 FIBA Men's Pre-Olympic Qualifiers,nba,"The 32 teams that are qualified for the FIBA World Cup are already well underway with their preparations and friendly games for the actual tournament that begins on August 25th. However, there is a lesser publicized group of 5 tournaments that are taking place across 6 countries that begins today, featuring 40 of the best national teams that *failed* to qualify for the World Cup. Here is a preview of these tournaments and a quick explanation to their purpose.

# What is the purpose of the 2023 FIBA Men's Pre-Olympic Qualifiers?

First, here's a quick rundown of how 12 teams qualify for the Olympics next summer. France gets an autobid because they are hosting, and 7 teams qualify for the Olympics through their placement at the World Cup later this month. These 7 teams are the Top 2 teams from the Americas, Top 2 teams from Europe (not including France since they already qualified), and the best finishing teams from Asia, Africa, and Oceania (basically a formality for Australia). This gets us to 8 teams at the Olympics. The last 4 teams will qualify through Olympic Qualifying Tournaments that will happen next summer, with 24 teams participating 4 sets of qualifiers next summer. Last Olympic cycle, Luka put up a [30 point triple double](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpGV2j3aw40) to win Slovenia's OQT in Lithuania to get Slovenia qualified for Tokyo. 19 of these teams will qualify to these tournaments through their placement at the World Cup (basically the best finishing teams at the World Cup who didn't qualify for the Olympics outright). This leaves us with 5 teams.

In short, these 5 tournaments will send the 5 teams needed to fill these tournaments next summer. **Basically, the 2023 Pre-Olympic Qualifiers are a last chance effort for national teams who didn't qualify for the World Cup to keep their Olympic hopes alive.** 

# Where are these tournaments happening?

The 5 tournaments are continental tournaments, with Europe getting 2 tournaments and the Americas, Africa, and Asia each getting 1. Therefore, the 5 teams that go to the Olympic qualifiers next summer will have this same continental distribution. Here are the locations and the teams participating in each tournament. For context, all the tournaments except for Asia will involve two groups of 4 teams, with the top 2 teams in each group advancing to the semifinals. After that, its single elimination. For Asia, its just a round-robin now because Chinese Taipei and South Korea pulled out.

Europe #1 - Istanbul, Turkey

* Group A - Turkey, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Iceland
* Group B - Netherlands, Croatia, Belgium, Sweden

Europe #2 - Talinn, Estonia and Gliwice, Poland

* Group A - Czech Republic, North Macedonia, Israel, Estonia
* Group B - Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina

Americas - Santiago Del Estero, Argentina

* Group A - Cuba, Argentina, Bahamas (Panama pulled out)
* Group B - Uruguay, Virgin Islands, Chile, Colombia

**Yes, believe it or not, Argentina DID NOT qualify for the World Cup after winning the Silver Medal in 2019. If you are interested,** [here are the highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=307pEFvtu4o) **to the last do or die World Cup qualifier from February in which the Dominican Republic eliminated them on home court. In short, it was an epic collapse under intense pressure. Shoutout to Jean Montero of the DR for a legendary performance that saved the DR and is now the reason we will see KAT in the Philippines.**

Africa - Lagos, Nigeria

* Group A - Senegal, Mali, Uganda, Nigeria
* Group B - DR Congo, Cameroon, Guinea, Tunisia

Asia - Damascus, Syria **(yes, you heard that right)**

* Round-Robin - India, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Syria

I wouldn't be making this post in r/nba if there weren't any notable NBA and former NBA players for their countries. Let's look at the 5 most exciting teams and their most notable players.

# Bahamas - DeAndre Ayton, Buddy Hield, Eric Gordon, Kai Jones

This is, without a doubt, the greatest FIBA squad the Bahamas has ever produced. For a country of just 400,000 people, the talent level on this team this summer is astonishing, but is also a testament to the fact that basketball is far and away the most popular sport on the islands. Buddy Hield has been a consistent presence in FIBA qualifiers for a while now for the Bahamas, but having Ayton, Gordon and Jones along with the rest of their squad consisting of college and overseas players make them the best team from a talent standpoint across these tournaments. The question is how much their lack of chemistry will hurt them going up against a more experienced Argentina team playing at home.

# Argentina - Facundo Campazzo, Luca Vildoza, Gabriel Deck, Carlos Delfino

Yes, Carlos Delfino is still playing. Coached by Timberwolves assistant Pablo Prigioni, this Argentina team has stagnated in terms of talent and the result of a poor generation of players that followed the famed Golden Generation is starting to show. Still reeling from their collapse against the Dominican Republic in February, Argentina is at its lowest point in men's basketball since the 1980s despite still ranking 4th in World Rankings. The last time they didn't participate at the World Cup was in 1982, and if they fail to qualify for Paris it would be their first Olympic absence since 2000. For a team who once reached the pinnacle of the basketball world in 2004, being at risk of their Olympic hopes getting dashed by the Bahamas is a drastic fall. Still, with players such as Facu, Vildoza and Deck still playing at the highest level of basketball in Europe, their team chemistry will make the presumed Bahamas-Argentina final game very competitive. 

# Bosnia and Herzegovina - Jusuf Nurkic, Luka Garza, Dzanan Musa

After an inspiring showing at EuroBasket last summer, this same team is adding Timberwolves bigman Luka Garza to an already talented team with two clear leaders in Jusuf Nurkic and Dzanan Musa. Nurkic is always fun to watch in FIBA because of his incredible passion he carries playing for Bosnia. This national team is always plagued with financial issues due to Bosnia's poor economy and corruption, but as long as the talent and continuity is there, they should be the favorites to advance from the Poland-Estonia tournament.

# Turkey - Alperen Sengun, Furkan Korkmaz, Onuralp Bitim, Omer Yurtseven

Rockets and Bulls fans, this squad will pique your interest. Alperen Sengun is always a pleasure to watch no matter where he is, and he is far and away the best player on this squad. However, this tournament will also be a good chance for Bulls fans to watch their new two-way player Onuralp Bitim, who has solid potential as an NBA player based off of his performances at the club level in Europe. Korkmaz and Yurtseven are still hanging on in the NBA, but its looking like their time is short unless they turn it around quickly. Turkey should be the favorite to win their tournament playing at home in Istanbul.

# Croatia - Ivica Zubac, Dario Saric, Mario Hezonja

Similar to Argentina, Croatia is at its worst point in men's basketball in a very long time. Its possibly the worst state its team has been in since the country gained independence in 1991. Despite their lack of success in recent times, the team still features some major talent, with Ivica Zubac being the star after Bojan Bogdanovic retired from international play. They are Turkey's biggest threat in the Istanbul tournament, but their lack of continuity in the past two summers will most likely continue to hurt them this summer.

David Robinson deserves a lot more respect and recognition for the 1999 title run.,nba," 

Now to start off, let me say this: I'm not saying David Robinson is better than Duncan (obviously not), but it seems to me that the younger generation seems to think that Duncan carried the Spurs on his back.

No, 1999 David Robinson was still a very good player.

1. He averaged 16 ppg on .500 shooting. At first glance, this doesn't look like very good numbers for a former MVP, especially a C, but David Robinson at this point, was playing second option to Duncan on offense. The Spurs were a low-scoring team and 16 was second-best. Duncan himself averaged ""only"" 22, while playing 8 mpg more. .500 shooting looks horrid for a C, but if you have actually seen David Robinson played, you know he operates a lot outside the paint as well. Duncan himself had a similar shooting percentage. Plus in 1999, shooting percentages across the league tanked. I won't say he was a beast on the offensive end (as he used to be), but I think he was an elite #2.
2. Still a defensive beast. 10 rpg is always decent. Duncan was averaging 11.5 Averaged just 0.2 bpg lesser than Duncan despite playing a full 8mpg lesser. Averaged 1.5 spg (way more than Duncan) and for a big man, 1.5 spg is damn good.

TLDR: I hate it when people seem to believe that David Robinson was just along for the ride for both his titles. Maybe the 2003 title but the 1999 title? He clearly still has plenty left in the tank and showed.",t5_2qo4s,1403,257,"David Robinson deserves a lot more respect and recognition for the 1999 title run.

"A humble, radical proposal to eradicate free throws",nba,"As a game designer and basketball fan, I have often pondered what changes I would make to the game we all love, if given the chance. So if I were put in charge of things at the NBA tomorrow, my first rule change would be this:

Any time a player is fouled, that player receives 2 points and their team gets a fresh possession of the ball. No free throws, no over or under a team limit, doesn't matter if it's offense or defense. Somebody fouls you, you get 2 points, your team gets the ball.

This change would benefit basketball's viewing experience by eliminating its most prolific filler. In an average NBA game, you will see nearly 50 free throws per game (per BBallRef). Basketball at its best showcases movement, rhythm, flow, a unique grace. People of all shapes and sizes flying around the court, flying through the air, zipping passes to in sync teammates, launching the ball mighty distances and moving with inspiration. Stopping all that so nine players can stand around and watch one do the exact same thing 50 times totally undercuts what people love about watching basketball.

Viewers, especially casual ones, would also benefit from the removal of fouling's esoteric metagame. Extremely regularly, teams and players are incentivized to intentionally and deliberately commit fouls for a variety of reasons - stopping the clock, putting a bad shooter at the line, mitigating a fastbreak, and more. The calculus of all these situations flips completely if fouling gives your opponent 2 points and the ball. Endings of games in particular would improve, as we wouldn't have to watch the endless parade to the free throw line in the waning minutes of games - a common feature of NBA games, and a commonly cited gripe by casual basketball fans.

Now at this point you're probably saying ""Hold on, this guy is a fan of the team that employs James Harden and Joel Embiid. Of course he wants to reward foul-baiting more!"" Which, look, if I were really in charge of the NBA tomorrow, yeah I would probably just rig the whole thing for the Sixers straight up. But that's not what I'm talking about here! And really, I'm not even talking about trying to get rid of free throws with this change, I'm talking about trying to get rid of fouls.

Fouls are called fouls because they're instances where you're breaking the rules. Shoving, smacking, tackling - these are unclean actions on the basketball court. The whole point of the game is that you can't just pick up the ball and run over the guy on the other team. You can't just grab somebody's hand to prevent them from scoring. Yet current basketball rules have normalized players doing exactly that. There are “smart fouls” every game every night of the NBA season. We could prevent those situations.

If we made this change overnight, we would probably see an historic explosion of point totals. Even the worst teams in the league would threaten to score 150 points every night.

But teams would adjust. The absolute pain inflicted by committing a foul would result in those tendencies getting coached out of players quickly. Foul baiting offensive players would still go hunting for contact, but defenders would be much more hesitant to get handsy or physical. This likely results in more open opportunities, more shot attempts from the field, and more scoring - which is what we're all here to see, right?

You might say ""what about defense?"", and in fact, another effect of this rule change would actually be to increase the value of elite defensive players. The greatest stoppers and rim protectors have always done what they do without fouling. Such skills become even more of a premium when fouls become extra costly.

There would also be other ripple effects, like timeouts becoming more valuable, fewer opportunities for substitutions, and players' conditioning needing to adjust with fewer regular stoppages.

Ultimately this rule change aims to make watching basketball more approachable, by removing one of its most boring and convoluted aspects. I will leave you with two quotes, from a heckling spurs fan and then-Rocket James Harden. My hope is to one day live in a world where they are both happy.

After the Lakers lost to the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals, in one of the most influential (but not reported due to profanity) moments in modern NBA history, Shaquille O'Neal got up on stage at club in New York City and unleashed a freestyle rap mocking Kobe Bryant for being unable to win the NBA Finals without him.

There are of course many things that led to the modern era, but Shaq's diss, including firing strays at Patrick Ewing for having no rings as well, and leading the entire club in a chorus of ""Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes,"" led to Kobe obsessively chasing his next two rings without Shaq, which he did indeed win (though he did need the return of Phil Jackson and others).

Some have said that this era of battling between Shaq and Kobe to win without each other influenced the media to focus excessively on championship rings, and indirectly led to an entire generation of players desperately hopping teams to avoid the taste of Shaq's ass.

Where do you think Kelly Oubre Jr. will end up? Will he make an impact for a contender in the upcoming season?,nba,"I know, it's easy to say make jokes and say ""Shanghai,"" ""Taiwan,"" ""Toronto"" etc. but Oubre is coming off a season in which he quietly put up **20.3** ppg, **5.2** rpg, **1.1** apg on could-be-worse efficiency for a terrible Hornets team.

Like fellow mid-August free agent Christian Wood, he's known as an offense-first ball stopper. Unlike Wood, he's not considered a headcase and has never played on a good team. I'm surprised there hasn't been more of a market for him.

I could still see him ending up with a few playoff hopefuls:

**Mavericks:** This could be the ideal landing spot for Oubre, who becomes the third option on a contender that's trying to zag where others zig, putting ball-dominant scorers around their star like the Lakers did with LeBron in his first season there.

**Pacers:** That team has an unselfish point guard but needs anyone who can play forward. Oubre would immediately become the best-looking person to ever hold Indiana residency.

**Bucks:** They need a spark, and his selfish tendencies would likely be ironed out within one of the league's best team cultures. 

**Grizzlies:** They have Ziaire Williams and David Roddy to fill the void left by Dillon Brooks, but adding Oubre would let them play big and have another scorer during Ja's suspension. Might be too many cooks in the kitchen, though.

**76ers**: Depending on what happens with Harden, they're also thin at the wings and might need another scorer to play off of Embiid and Maxey. I think this would require Oubre signing for the minimum, but it seems like there's no market for the dude right now.

"If past NBA Players were picked up by the Delorean from Back To The Future during their prime and they were dropped into the NBA in 2023, who would be successful and who would not?",nba,"I'm curious about this. The game has changed a lot throughout the years. If the Delorean picked up some of them up during their prime and they dropped them in the NBA in 2023, the results would definitely vary. Some players might be successful but some wouldn't.

Who do you think would be successful in the NBA today? Who wouldn't be successful? I'll try to make guesses myself. I'll try to be as objective as possible. Feel free to add players to the discussion as well.

1. Bill Russell: Success - His Defense, Basketball IQ, Positioning and Rebounding are off the charts. He's also a decent playmaker and had good touch around the rim. He would be a much better version of Rudy Gobert but unlike Gobert, he could score in the paint and he wouldn't be a liability on offense. He would be a defensive monster like Brook Lopez or Gobert who could pass out of the post and score from the painted area. He would also be way more athletic and mobile than these two guys.
2. Larry Bird: Success - He would be  on the same level Luka and The Joker (or possibly even above them) but with much better shooting. He wouldn't be a defensive liability who you'd need to hide. Luka and Jokic aren't elite on defense but they're serviceable. Larry Bird would be the same.
3. Jerry West: Success (but not as a three point shooter) - Jerry West was a good shooter but based on his highlights, he didn't take any shots from three-point range. There wasn't a three point line during his time but if you drew an imaginary three point line during his playing days, his shots would probably come from mid-range or the top of the key at the furthest. He was elite on defense though. I think he would be like Jimmy Butler. Just like Jimmy, he can score consistently inside the 3 point line, he's tough-as-nails, he's elite on defense, but he doesn't attempt much threes.
4. Wilt Chamberlain: Success - Anyone with his physical attributes and level of skill as a Basketball player would be a success regardless of the era or nature of the game. He would be at least as good as Giannis today.
5. Bob Cousy: Flop - He could pass and dribble but he would get cooked on defense. He wasn't an efficient scorer either. He shot 37.5% for his career and he didn't have an outside shot.
6. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Success - No one from any era would be able to stop the Skyhook. Kareem also had an endless bag of tricks down low and he would dominate the NBA today at his physical peak.
7. George Gervin: Success - The Iceman could get buckets at will. His finishing around the painted area was elite, his midrange shot was good, and his touch was silky smooth. He would be like Demar DeRozan from a few seasons ago when he didn't attempt as much threes as he does now. However, I'm willing to bet that he would score more than Demar today.
8. George Mikan: Flop - He wouldn't be able to stop modern big men today. He also lacked athleticism. While he might be able to score around the post, he wasn't known for being a defensive specialist compared to other old-school centers. He wouldn't do well if he was plucked straight from his time.
9. Dr. J: Success - No one could really shut him down. He was one of those guys who could get to the paint at will no matter who you put on him. He would be at least as good as SGA when it comes to having the ability to get into the paint. In addition to this, he would be at least as good as Ja Morant in terms of athletic ability and finishing at the rim.",t5_2qo4s,3464,642,"If past NBA Players were picked up by the Delorean from Back To The Future during their prime and they were dropped into the NBA in 2023, who would be successful and who would not?I'm curious about this.

It's kinda amazing that the top 3 spots, the only ones to hit the 70-mark, belong to three guys without a ring. Understandably, they made a lot of playoff game appearances by being dueling each other and being mainstays in the eastern conference finals.

James Harden is the only one in the top echelon that hasn't made an NBA finals appearance in the last five years.

"In 2005-06, Mike James had the most random 20+ ppg season by any player ever and was arguably a top 20 offensive player that year (-&gt; story time)",nba,"The OG Mike James of basketball went undrafted in 1998, then played in the USBL, CBA and Europe until getting a shot with the Miami Heat at age 26. He would end up playing in the NBA for 12 seasons on 11 teams.

He started his NBA career with a reputation for being a tough, defensive backup point guard with a nice outside shot but little playmaking ability.

Flashback to Summer 2005, on the first day of training camps, Houston traded Mike James to Toronto for Skip to My Lou.

Coming off 3 straight seasons of &lt; 41% win rate under 3 different coaches, Toronto was in the midst of a massive overhaul. They'd just moved on from Vince Carter during the previous season and shifted their offseason focus on building around a 21 year old Chris Bosh. They had a glaring hole at PG and Mike had just had a solid but unexceptional 2004-05 season playing backup PG split between Milwaukee and Houston. They also signed a 24 year old rookie Jose Calderon from Spain, but bizarrely used him as a backup SG so Mike got to run the show.

Their moves didn't yield improvement to their wins (they went 27-55...ended up getting #1 pick Andrea Bargnani at the 2006 draft), but did make Toronto one of the more entertaining teams that season: 2nd ranked offense and 2nd to last ranked defense. 
At the head of that offensive explosion was Mike James. 
He started 79 games and averaged 20.3ppg, 5.8apg, on 58% TS (44% from 3) and 25% usage in 37mpg. He had a 4.0 OBPM, 7.7 offensive win shares and -0.1 defensive win shares. He ranked top 20 in the league for points, assists, EFG%, turnovers, OWS and OBPM.

-

Prior to the year with Toronto, Mike had played in 248 games across the 4  previous seasons for 5 teams and averaged 9.2 ppg, 3.5 apg on 51% TS (36% from 3) and 20% usage in 24mpg. He had accumulated 5.8 OWS, 5.5 DWS, and a 0.0 OBPM. He was on minimums his first 3 seasons and turned playing 10mpg during the championship run of the 2003-04 Pistons into a $6.5M over 2 years contract with Milwaukee.

After his breakout season in Toronto, 31 year old James was a UFA and signed a $23.5M over 4 year contract offers from Minnesota, Houston and Dallas.
He ended up signing with Minnesota because they were the only team to offer him both a Player Option in year 3 and a Trade Kicker.
Ironically, 1 year into his deal in Minnesota he was traded him back to Houston for Juwan Howard giving him a nice 15% pay bump thanks to that trade kicker. 

In his season with Minnesota he turned back into a pumpkin as he reverted back to his pre-2005 averages: 25.2mpg and put up 10.1 ppg, 3.6 apg on 53% TS and 20% usage to get 1.8 OWS, 1.1 DWS, and -0.6 OBPM for the season.

He'd go on to play 186 more games across 6 more seasons for 6 teams and never averaged double-digit points per game or a positive OBPM again.",t5_2qo4s,3013,555,"In 2005-06, Mike James had the most random 20+ ppg season by any player ever and was arguably a top 20 offensive player that year (-&gt; story time)The OG Mike James of basketball went undrafted in 1998, then played in the USBL, CBA and Europe until getting a shot with the Miami Heat at age 26.

Bandwagon or not?,nba,"I've loved basketball since I was young and I've been a fan of our own national basketball league (i'm not from USA). However, growing up, I started hearing about the NBA, I was not really interested back then but eventually its influence grew in my school. Some of my friends started betting on NBA finals games, I don't want to miss out on all the fun so I joined. I remember the first time I bet on an NBA Finals game was during the first Spurs vs Heat finals matchup. The only NBA player I know back then is Kobe and LeBron since they're very popular in my country, Kobe ain't in the finals so I bet on the team where LeBron plays. I don't know him, I'm not a fan of him, I don't know everything about the NBA, I don't even watch the games, I just wait for the news lol. Next year, I started betting on some games in the playoffs, I remember I bet on the Pacers against the Heat, then bet on Spurs in the Finals. I'm not consistently betting on a single team, I just bet on any team that I feel like will win. Then another year went by and this time, I'm starting to like the NBA more rather than our national basketball league. So I started watching and exploring the NBA, then one team caught my eyes, it was the Golden State Warriors. I always love sharpshooters back then, my playstyle is more on shooting since it's been influenced not by Steph Curry, but by my fave player/sharpshooter in our national basketball league. I saw Curry and his insane shooting and how energetic and fun he plays so I instantly become a fan of him and his team. I started watching GSW games, I got hooked, and long story short, I am still a Warriors fan until now, through their ups and down. I am from overseas, the NBA is not from my country, we have our own basketball league, yet the Warriors made me love the NBA. Now I have an NBA team to always root for.

My question is, would you consider me a bandwagon? If yes, why? And if you can, please explain the conditions that should be met to get labeled as a bandwagon? If no, then why as well? I don't really care that much, I just love the NBA and GSW but part of me wants to know. I would appreciate your insights and constructive criticisms.

Was Kyrie Irving at any point a top 10 player in the league?,nba,"So yesterday there was a tweet asking who had a better career - Kyrie Irving or Klay Thompson.
