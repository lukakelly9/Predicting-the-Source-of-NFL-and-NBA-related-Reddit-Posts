0,Erik Burkhardt shares some incredible revelations of former Browns QB Johnny Manziel in The Untold Story of Johnny Football. Here are a few that pertained to the NFL.,nfl,"Just watched the new special, there is a lot revealed about Johnny's college days but a surprising amount about his brief time in the NFL.

First is that Manziel was being drug tested by Burkhardt every week leading up to the NFL Combine. The night before the Combine, Manziel went to a party in the hills. **His Dad faked a heart attack so he could leave the Combine early**.

Second, the Houston Texans were going to take Manziel over Clowney, but video surfaced of him partying not long after his private workout with the team and they took him off their draft board.

Third, Manziel had dinner with the Browns and then partied at a hotel room with his receivers who were going to catch for him the night before a private workout and the receivers were so hungover a hungover himself Manziel **threw to his agent and his lawyer**. He told a reporter who covered the Aggies that he ""fucking killed it"" in the workout. Really.

Finally the second most amazing thing to me behind the fact that **Johnny's family wasn't actually loaded** (I know, right?!?!), Manziel's agent Burkhardt basically begged Jimmy Haslam to **come back in to the first and take Johnny**. Burhardt said his career was on the line. My immediate thoughts on this were holy shit it is cray how fluid the draft is, and now Haslam saying a ""homeless"" guy told him to draft Manziel makes *a lot* more sense.

Pretty crazy stuff and I know a lot of people won't watch here because they don't watch college football so thought I'd share.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15ms2ik

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

66,In 2006 Adam Vinatieri had the best postseason performance by kicker.,nfl,"In 2006 Adam Vinatieri had joined the Colts as a free agent after the Colts were fed up with Mike Vanderjagt shanking in the post season. The Colts went 12-4 in the regular season and held the 3rd seed. 

**In that postseason he scored 49 points for the Colts. He is 1 of 2 kickers to break 40 points in the post season with the other being Evan McPherson in 2021 with 48** 

He achieved this by scoring **14** field goals out of **15** attempts  and 7 extra point attempts. 14 field goals made is the most in any post season. 

**Vinatieri made a total of 6 field goals from beyond the 40 yard line** 

Wild card *Chiefs game* ***23-8***

* **48**  yard field goal 
* **19** yard field goal 
* **50** yard field goal 

The best showcase  his dominance is to look at his 2006 divisional performance against the Ravens. The Colts would upset the 13-3 Ravens at home **without a single touchdown. Colts win 15-6.**

Vinatieri scored every point in that game with 5 field goals 

* **23** yard field goal 
* **42**  yard field goal
* **51** yard field goal 
* **48** yard field goal 
* **35** yard field goal

AFC Championship *Patriots game* ***38-34***

* **42** yard field goal 
* **26** yard field goal 
* **36** yard field goal 

*Superbowl 41*  ***29-17***

* **29**  yard field goal 
* **24** yard field goal 
* **20** yard field goal 

What makes this performance impressive isn't just that he scored the most points in a post season but the fact that the Colts sought Vinatieri out as a free agent because they wanted the best Kicker in the league and Vanderjagt wasn't cutting it in the post season. Vinatieri comes in and immediately proves his worth helping the Colts win the  superbowl. He showed he could be relied upon when he was the only one who could score, he showed up against his former team, and showed he could kick in harsh weather conditions as there were heavy rains in superbowl 41. Vinatieri has the most dominant post season kicking performance of all time.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15n9bgi

**Division: [NFC East]**





**Coaching Changes:**






Well, no Moore lighting up the scoreboard, I guess. With the departure of Kellen Moore to the Chargers, things have taken a turn in Jerryworld, and it’s up to new offensive coordinator Brian Cornelius Schottenheimer and Mike Mcarthy’s “Texas Coast Offense” as to whether or not thats a good thing. (Writers note: the Texas coast is 418 miles from ATT Stadium.) 





Schottenheimer, most recently an offensive coordinator in Seattle from ‘18-‘20 and the passing game coordinator under Coach Fingerguns in Jacksonville in ‘21,  is a bit of a milquetoast replacement for Moore. For instance, in his first year in Seattle, he ran the ball 64% of the time on first down, 54% of the time on second down, and passed 73% of the time on third down. Ideal for a team who’s running back room has a guy that has never been a 3 down back, a hobbit, and a few other warm bodies. 




If Schottenhiemer’s reputation for going run run pass wasn’t enough to get Cowboys fans excited, we also rehired Mike Solari as our offensive line coach. I say rehired, because Solari has been an offensive line coach for the Cowboys before- when Tom Landry was the head coach. Solari was most recently with Seattle from ‘18-‘21, and of all the offensive line units of all time, those Seattle units during those years were some of them, consistently grading out in the bottom half of the league in both pass blocking and run blocking according to PFF, and flat out failing the eye test. 




Former Birmingham Iron draft pick Scott Tolzien takes over QB coaching duties from Doug Nussmeier, who went to LA with Moore. Tolzien was a coaching assistant for us last year, and is an all around new face to the coaching community, getting his first job in 2019 as the Wisconsin Badgers scouting analyst. Hopefully he can teach Dak to get his footwork right.





**Free Agency**







There is an Ewok shaped hole in the hearts of all Cowboy fans this year, as we had to cut our worst center but 3rd all time rushing leader in franchise history, Ezekiel Elliot. There are 16.7 million reasons why we had to part ways with Zeke this year,  3.8 yards per carry and an ascending Tony Pollard being chief amongst them. 





As of writing, Zach Martin, our all universe guard, is holding out for a raise, which is reasonable as he is arguably the best guard in the NFL right now and a future Hall of Famer, but is the 8th highest paid guard in the NFL. Pay the man, Jerry, he’s earned it, and we already don’t have depth at offensive line after losing Connor Mgovern to the Jets and with Tyron Smith held together by duct tape, Toradol, and hope. 





Former Bill, Patriot, Panther,  and Colt, Stefon Gilmore rounds out an already stacked Cowboys secondary on a 2yr/ $20 million contract, with $14 million guaranteed. We got a 2 time first team All Pro, 5 time Pro Bowler, Former DPOY for a bag of balls, and a 2023 5th to the Colts. The hope here isn’t that the 33 year old CB repeats his 2019 performance as the DPOY for the Patriots, but that he is simply just good. Surrounded by that suffocating defense, including fellow  first team All Pro CB Trevon Diggs, who signed a 5yr/ $97 million extension at the beginning of camp this year, if he stays healthy and just has an average Stephon Gilmore season, our defense has a chance to be terrifying this year.








Former Saint, Patriot, Ram, and Texan, Brandin Cooks provides a much needed vertical threat at WR on a 2yr/ $39,764,000 contract with $36 million guaranteed. For 2 pick swaps with Houston, a 2023 fifth and 2024 sixth, We get his 4.33 speed, and if the former Belitnikoff award winner just runs wind sprints up and down the field on 9 routes to clear out space for CeeDee to do his thing, he will be well worth the money. 







Former Toronto FC, Bethlehem Steel FC, and Birmingham Stallion Brandon Aubrey will compete for the Kicking job against hopefully someone better than him, as we have just cut former 49er, Charger, and Cardinal Tristan Vizcaino, who was not better than him, so unless we figure out how to hire a football player instead of a soccer player to replace Brett Maher, who forgot you’re supposed to put the ball between the uprights, not every other imaginable place, then i guess we got our guy?






**Draft**





**1.26: Mazi Smith (DT)**




With the 26th overall pick, we took Michigan’s Mazi Smith, with the hopes that he can become the 2 gapping monster in the middle that he was in college. Brian Baldinger compared him to Suh, which is just the insane overreaction i’m looking for in a 1st round Dallas Cowboys draft pick. A+ draft grade for that alone. 





**2.58: Luke Schoonmaker (TE)**




Fellow mitten shaped state (university? Not the one that has the word state in it. I don’t want the blue guys telling me they aren’t the green guys) alumni Luke Schoonmaker is by all accounts just a younger, better version of Dalton Schultz, and continues our weird streak of having a white TE that i’m pretty sure we’ve had going since Billy Joe DuPree retired in 1983. This is a solid B draft grade





**3.90: Demarvion Overshown (LB)**





A converted safety turned linebacker, Demarvion Overshown out of Texas is a coverage specialist at LB that is a fantastic depth piece, his profile reads a ton like Jayron Kearse, so having him at backup just gives Dan Quinn another speedy piece to  add to his arsenal. A solid A for draft grade, simply for getting this guy this late 





**4.129: Viliami Fehoko Jr. (DE)**





Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year Viliami Fehoko Jr out of San Jose State is a bit of a project, as we drafted him for the same reason we drafted Mazi Smith in the first round- we need him to be a run stopper in the middle, so there is some beefing up he has to do to not get killed when moved to DT. This is one of my least favorite picks this year, as it’s not really a position of need after picking up Mazi, and we could have picked up depth at offensive line, but all together he is an interesting player that could potentially turn into something special. Solid C draft grade






**5.169: Asim Richards (OT)**




Out of UNC with an 82 inch wingspan, Asim Richards is going to get moved inside to guard, and is going to compete in training camp with Matt Farniok, Josh Ball, and Chuma Edoga for the backup Left Guard spot. we need depth at OL, and he seems ok for his draft position, solid B for a draft grade 





**6.178: Eric Scott Jr. (CB)**




Wtf Jerry we already have 6 of these what are you doing? That being said we traded up for him, so somebody saw something more nuanced than literally just some guy from the internet. What’s the most neutral grade? C+ or B-? Whichever one is more like distilled water, pick that for the draft grade 





**6.212: Deuce Vaughn (RB)**




The video of Cowboys scout Chris Vaughn calling his son, Deuce Vaughn, to draft him in the 6th round is one of the most heartwarming scenes of this years draft. And it’s not all Kumbaya bullshit, Deuce is a fuckin dawg my dude. He had north of 1500 yards on the ground his senior season at Kansas state, and is a quicker than fast back seemingly built to be and understudy to Tony Pollard. The thing about him though, and it is a thing, is that there are NFL players who own cars who’s rims are taller than Deuce. Mr Vaughn is just 6 inches taller than being legally a dwarf, which brings real limits to his roll in an NFL offense. Draft grade: A+ times 10 plus a million. One of the steals of the draft this year 





**7.244: Jalen Brooks (WR)**





Lmao wut?  7th round for a guy that had 58 catches for 785 yards and 2 td’s at South Carolina? Practice team body at best. Draft grade: Jerry’s internet got disconnected and they went on auto draft 







**Other Offseason News that Affected the Team**





**The Texas Coast Offense**





Ok, listen, I understand people doubting that Brian Cornelius Shottenheimer and Michael John McCarthy could possibly come up with an innovative Offense in 2023, but hear me out, it might not actually suck. I know i gave that horrendous run/pass statistic in the coaching changes section about Shottenheimer, but, those were very cherry picked stats. Yes, he did run 64% on 1st, 53% on second, and passed on 73% of third downs in 2018, but in 2019, it was 54% run on 1st, 47% on second down, and passed on 75% of third downs, and by 2020, he was finally starting to get it, never running more than 50% of the time. And Mike McCarthy never went below a 50% pass/run per down  in his last 2 years at Green Bay. What that hopefully means, especially with the lack of depth at running back, is that the “Texas Coast” offense is ridiculously reliant on Dak’s arm and our absolute arsenal of pass catchers. If we have a TE develop into a safety valve across the middle, be it either Jake Ferguson or Luke Schoonmaker, we will dink and dunk our way deep into the playoffs. The hope here is that Tony Pollard becomes an Austin Ekler type of player, more of a pass catcher than a between the tackles bruiser, not that either couldn’t, but, with realistically one running back on the roster and then a bunch of guys trying their hardest, passes where Pollard steps out of bounds being as frequent as Pollard taking a pounding in the fucking B gap isn’t the worst idea. I reserve my right to not hate it until Week 1





**Zach Martin holding out**




A very recent, and a very urgent issue. Without future HoF Martin, our interior protection, the thing that affects pocket passers the most, which i guess Dak is now, really isn’t very good at all. IDGAF if Jerry has to give Martin 10% of the team, just make it happen. We need him and he has earned more than whatever he is asking for




**Projected Starting Lineup**





**QB: Rayne Dakota Prescott**




It’s now or never for Dak, going into year 8, his age 30 season, with weapons like Brandin Cooks, CeeDee Lamb, Tony Pollard, and a top 3 defense, the expectation is a championship run. If he gets his turnover’s under control, this team can be lethal. He had a career high and league “leading” 15 interceptions last year, and we still finished the season with the second highest turnover differential, at +10. If Dak really can limit it to uNdEr 1o interceptions, which may be harder than it should be given McCarthy’s historical over reliance on spot and curl routes, than by virtue of the sheer number of times we will have the ball, he will put up insane numbers. With his declining rushing abilities, it’s imperative he works on his in the pocket footwork, which is somewhat concerning given he has a new QB coach who is basically in his first real year as a coach. That being said, the sky is the limit this year for Dak, but the floor is beneath the basement, because if he can’t take this team past the divisional, than that will be his legacy. 





**RB Tony Pollard**






At 5.1 yards per carry, Tony Pollard was the third most efficient running back in the league last year, and this year we are going to ask even more of him. We need him to be our lead runner,  which is a massive ask for a guy that has never in his life been a 3 down back. Unless we can get an discounted Zeke, Dalvin Cook, or Leonard Fournette, or a rookie steps up, i’m afraid we are going to run a fresh off a broken left leg and a high ankle sprain Tony Pollard until the wheels fall off. 





**TE1: Jake Ferguson**





2nd year Tight End Jake Ferguson is going to start the year as our TE1, but with second round draft pick Luke Schoonmaker in the TE room, he’s going to have to prove himself not only as a safety valve for Dak this year, but also going to have to improve his run blocking if he’d like to keep the starting job. 





**TE2: Luke Schoonmaker**







The expectations around second round draft pick Luke Schoonmaker are sky high, even if he is off to a rough start- “Schoon” comes into camp with a non football injury on his foot, one that had him in a boot during mini camp. Rookie TE seasons are historically pretty rough, so if he heals up and can be a contributor in 12 personnel this season and gives us hope for the future, the buzz around him next year will be ridiculous  





**WR1: Brandin Cooks**




Entering his year 30 season on his 5th team, Brandin Cooks is going to be our true X Wide Reciever, most likely getting most of his action on the outside edge of the numbers. We have needed a replacement for Amari Cooper for a year now, and by the looks of it, we found our guy- his blazing speed is his greatest asset as a Cowboy, and he will, if not blow the top off defenses, at least clear out some deep defenders to let CeeDee do CeeDee things. A massive upgrade at WR and to our passing game






**WR2: Michael Gallup**






Now a full year after his ACL was torn, Micael Gallup is set for a massive comeback year as our Z receiver. The last time he played a full season without getting hurt and was completely healthy all year, he caught 66 balls for 1107 yards and 6 TD’s.






**Slot WR: CeeDee Lamb**






With Michael Gallup healthy and Brandin Cooks signed, CeeDee will be able to do what he does best this year- be a devastating threat out of the slot position. The only negative thing i can think of when it comes to CeeDee is his celebration- sniffing your finger is weird, man, like, you play one of the most violent contact sports on the planet, are you even sure where that finger was before you sniffed it? 








**LT: Tyron Smith**





The corpse of potential hall of famer Tyron Smith continues to hold down our Left Side when he is healthy. The rare moments of being cleared to play are filled with dominant run and pass blocking that can only be learned through years of experience and winning the genetic lottery, but pick a ligament on the human body. Any one will do. Now pick a year between 2011 and now. I promise, at worst, you’ll be a few years off from when he tore that ligament. Poor guy is an absolute soldier for running it back this year, but my god i hope somebody that loves him sits him down soon to tell him it may be time to hang up the cleats. At this point, i just want him to have a long and healthy retirement, and i’m actually concerned he’s risking that. Stay safe Tyron, and Dallas will always love you






**LG: Tyler Smith**





For a guy that got moved out to Left Tackle his rookie season midway through training camp, Tyler Smith “performed above expectations” the same way Jalen Hurts did last year. In his natural Guard position, hopefully he is a dominate as advertised, but who are we kidding here, He’ll be LT again as soon as Tyron Smith gets hurt. And honestly, he’ll probably be our LT moving forward after this season, guy legitimately does not suck






**C: Tyler Biadasz**







Drafting a Center is as complicated as drafting a quarterback, but drafting a center before like round 5 will get GM’s fired, and because Stephen Jones is smart enough to not want his dad to take back over those responsibilities, Mr. Biadasz will return this year as our Center. He tries his best and we appreciate that, but there is a list of like 15 Centers i’d rather have 







**RG: Zach Martin**






Jerry give this man so many dollars please. The eight time all pro is considered one of the best Offensive Lineman of all time, lets not fuck around and find out with this hold out from camp






**RT: Terrence Steele**






Another guy who exceeded expectations last year, Terrence Steele is a budding star at right tackle, exponentially improving each year since he was drafted in 2020. He’s no Lane Johnson, but most people aren’t, and people who watch this sort of thing think big things about Steele. Definitely one of the more interesting Cowboys to watch this year






**DT: Osa Odighizuwa**






Our definitive DT1 until Mazi proves he is who we think he is, 24 year old Odighizuwa  will have to be the veteran leadership for our IDL group. With 4 sacks and consistent talk about how poor we were at stopping the inside run last year, he seems more like a placeholder for Mazi more than anything we hope to see past week 9 outside of packages that need more than 3 Defensive Lineman






**DT2: Mazi Smith**





Rookie Mazi Smith is going to be asked to be a monster 2 gapping run stopper that shores up one of the very few week points our defense had last year- allowing 129.29 yards per game on the ground last year played a massive roll in our post season embarrassment against that team in Santa Clara. Even if his stats aren’t great this year, as long as he eats both blockers and space and allows Micah and D-Law to fly around, he will be well worth the draft capital we spent on him.  





**DE/Edge: Micah Parsons**






A top 3 defensive player, let alone an edge rusher, we have been building this entire defense around this man for at least a year at this point. Finishing this year outside of the top 3 for DPOY would be a massive let down for Micah, and would probably mean he got injured. The best part of that is that he is still learning how to be an edge rusher- he never did this in college and has only been a pro for 2 years, he’s only going to get better.  






**DE: DeMarcus Lawrence**






With all the buzz around Micah and Diggs, it’s easy to forget that D-Law is an elite pass rusher in his own right, and has been since 2014. The 2 fumble recoveries, 6 sacks, 65 combined tackles and 9 TFL’s he had last year was a down year for him. While he may not repeat his stellar 2017 performance, if he can give us an injury free average year, our defense will be suffocating






**Will LB: Leighton Vander Esch**






Is LVE a good linebacker? No really, i’m asking, because he’s not bad, like i can guarantee you that, i mean 90 Combined tackles is well above “this guy stinks” territory by a good measure, but also, it’s definitely not in elite territory. He was the 46th leading tackler amongst linebackers last year, which is definitely a stat that i had to look up. As much as it sounds like i’m lukewarm on him, i’m not, as he is probably our best true linebacker, but unless he takes a massive leap, he’s just not that exciting to talk about.   






**Mike LB: Jabril Cox**





We haven’t seen much from Cox since he tore his ACL in week 8 of his rookie season in 2021. He played 9 games last year, mostly on special teams, but in college, he was a coverage specialist LB, and with Dan Quinn’s propensity of putting safeties in the box and dropping LB’s into coverage, he is a scheme fit, but so is 4th round pick Demarvion Overshown out of Texas, so if his knee can’t hold up, we do have something in place that will probably be a lateral step instead of a step down







**Sam LB: Damone Clark**







Coming off of a Herniated disk in 2022, there is real hype surrounding Clark in this year’s camp, with Leighton Vander Esch going as far to say “i think we are seeing the beginning of an outstanding career.” Trying to cut through all the hype and glowing words in every article i found about him is challenging- everybody connected to the cowboys absolutely loves this guy. An unknown with a huge upside by the looks of it







**CB1: Trevon Diggs**







The 97 million dollar man will be a cornerstone of our defense this year,  and while Trevon developed a bit of a reputation in ‘21 when he got 11 interceptions but gave up a thousand yards in coverage, he has cleaned up some of his more dangerous risk taking tendencies and has become one of the best all around corners in the league. 







**CB2: Stefon Gillmore**





Having a former DPOY play opposite of Trevon Diggs while Micah Parsons pass rushes feels like cheating. It’s not like he’s really even on the decline either- with 66 combined tackles and 2 interception for the Colts last year, he was an absolute weapon in Indianapolis. 






**CB3: DaRon Bland**




With 5 interceptions, DaRon Bland was one of the best rookie corners in the league last year, which is a big statement when you consider last year’s corner class that included guys like Sauce Gardner and Tariq Woolen. The hope for this year is that he primarily plays slot defender in our nickel sets, and continues his quiet ascension into elite territory.  





**SS: Donavan Wilson**






One of the most underrated safeties in the league, Wilson is an old school you-hear-him-when-he-gets-there hit stick type of player. Can occasionally have issues in coverage, but his ability to defend his run fit is beyond top tier, which is just a perfect scheme fit for Quinn, who loves having Safeties in the box. 







**FS: Jayron Kearse**






Kearse has been doing doing a ton of work for us at the hybrid LB/safety position that Dan Quinn loves, and while 4th rounder Overshown is a insurance in case Jabril Cox can’t make it though this season, long term, Overshown is destined to replace Kearse, so my big hope for him is that he is a good mentor to the younger guys. He’s amazing in his own right, but, come next year, he’s probably a cap casualty, which is super unfair to him, given how well he has played for us the past 2 years. But, with Donavan Wilson and Malik Hooker on the team, it’s hard to justify paying him that big money next contract.







**Nickel Safety: Malik Hooker**







The fact that we have 3 great corners and 3 great safeties has me at a bit of a loss of words while writing this. Malik Hooker is legitimately elite, and he doesn’t even start in this iterations of the Dallas Cowboys because we have that much depth at DB on this team. Saying he doesn’t start is of course very much understating his roll on this defense- with 3 picks and 44 tackles last year, he sees action all of the time, but is he the nickel back or is DaRon Bland? Or is deciding to try and pass the ball on this defense just an overall poor choice? Yes. The answer to both questions is yes. 






**1 K: Brandon Aubrey**







Brandon Aubrey is a soccer player cos playing as a football player. He may be great, i don’t know because i have never seen him kick, nor has anyone else. After Maher, you’d think we’d be dropping real coin on a one year from one of those free agent vets like Gould or Crosby, but hey, at least we got a guy with impeccable cardio i guess.







**1 P: Bryan Anger**






St. Anger was Metallica’s worst album, but with an 83 yard boot against the Bears last year, i know i am not the only cowboys fan that gave that album a re listen .  The album still sucks, but Bryan Anger is a weapon and i’m stoked we kept him for this year






**PR/KR: KaVontae Turpin**






USFL MVP Kavontae Turpin will get a return TD this year, you heard it here first. With 303 total punt return yards and a long of 53, and 508 Kick return yards with a long of 63, this man is an explosive play waiting to happen. I know it’s kind of uncouth to talk about “heart” when it comes to professional athletes, but this man seemingly has it beyond reproach. The former Wroclaw Panther and New Jersey General was destined to be in the NFL, and i’m just glad he and his 4.3 40 found a home in Dallas




**Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses**








**QB:** 









Cooper Rush is a serviceable backup, but if Dak stays healthy and cleans up his interceptions, he will be a top 10 QB this year







**Backfield:** 






Tony Pollard has a chance to be truly great this year, but he is coming off an injury and we have absolutely no depth at RB, so this group also has a chance at being disastrous this year. Maybe Deuce Vaughn steps up and is the guy he was at Kansas State, but at 5’5”, there are real limitations for his roll in the pass catching game at the NFL level. 










**OL:** 





The days of us having the best offensive line in the league is over, unfortunately. There is no way the shambling husk of Tyron Smith will make it through 17 games, and while we can slide Tyler Smith out to LT and slot Chuma Edoga in at Left Guard,  we lack real proven depth at OL. Center Tyler Biadasz, arguably the worst starter on the team, plays next to a Zach Martin, inarguably the best starter on this team, who is holding out from camp as of time of writing, and if he does hold out, our OL goes from pretty good to pretty bad in a pretty big damned hurry. On a brighter note, Terrence Steele is a burgeoning star at right tackle, exponentially improving each year since he was drafted in 2020. 







**Pass catchers:** 




Cooks, Lamb, Pollard sounds like a recipe with an ingredient you gotta go to the “ethnic” grocery store to find, but actually, its a recipe for an offense that will most likely average around 30 points a game this year. Not to mention Gallup, and if we have a TE step up this year, this could be a very potent group if we stay healthy. 







**DL:** 



hopefully the addition of first round draft pick Mazi Smith shores up what was really the achilles heel of a very stout Cowboys defense last year. If he can be a big ol beefy run stuffing monster, we knocked the draft out of the park, if he can be a penetrating pass rushing DT, like Quinn wants him to be, we may have an all time defense on our hands here. Demarcus Lawrence and Micah Parsons, if you can even pigeon hole Parsons into being a DL, don’t hurt, either









**LB:** 






The linebacker room could be considered pretty mid, if it wasn’t for the multi talented Edge Micah Parsons. Leighton Vander Esch, Jabril Cox, and Damone Clark are like washing down a 5 star gourmet meal with tap water. It’s certainly not bad, but it stands out how aggressively average it is when surrounded by excellence. The addition of 3rd round draft pick Demarvion Overshown is very interesting in this linebacker room- he’s a coverage specialist linebacker more akin to Strong Safety Jayron Kearse than anybody in the Linebacker group, and with Dan Quinn’s proclivity for bringing safeties down into the box, he may end up being a real weapon on this defense. i’m not sure if i should be talking about him in this group, or in the secondary group, but because our linebackers need help, i’m going to put him in this group until proven otherwise. 









**Secondary:**







 this is the best group on the team, with Stefon Gilmore, and Trevon Diggs  as the headliners, it’s easy to forget that Jayron Kearse and Donavan Wilson are elite in their own right, and that DaRon Bland would be a starter on most teams and is only our slot guy because we are so utterly stacked everywhere else. 
Special Teams: PR/KR KaVontae Turpin and Punter Brian Anger are bright spots, but with some dude who has never played this sport in any meaningful way as our kicker, I’m not all together against just going for two every time. We need to do some work in free agency and get some ancient, but dependable, kicker like Robbie Gould or Mason Crosby. 






**Schedule Predictions**







**Week 1: DAL @ NYG**






Hopefully we break in Mazi here. Saquon is a problem unless Mazi makes it not a problem. I predict we will either cover the spread, or we will realize real quick that a first round draft pick was a mistake. Dallas -2.5







**Week 2: NYJ @ DAL**







We will lose this one, simply on account of that Aaron Rogers hates the Dallas Cowboys more than Lizzo likes making sure her background dancers have potassium in their diets. I predicted we get dunked on by a weak Green Bay team last year for the same reason, and i was right. If my app has anything less than DAL +6.5 I am hammering the Jets







**Week 3: DAL @ ARZ**







Late September in the desert will either be hot as fuck or simply hot as hell. Which will suck. I hope this is the week we debut Deuce Vaughn, simply as a Kyler Murray is short joke. Cowboys -13.5







**Week 4: NE @ DAL**






Nobody is giving the evil empire credit this year, when their defense is legit terrifying. I think we will win, but, even if nobody is hurt at this point in the year, i am hammering the under on this game. The winner of this game may legitimately not even break 20 points. Cowboys -1.5





**Week 5: DAL @ SF**






It’s a meaningless regular season game, we’ll win, maybe even convincingly, because there is no heartbreak without hope. Cowboys - 3.5 for this meaningless just above exhibition game. +6.5 for the inevitable divisional round playoff game







**Week 6: DAL @ LAC**





Continuing our Californian field trip, we face off against the Chargers in a Kellen Moore revenge game. If this isn’t a prime time game, it’s only because the Chargers Chargered. Flip a coin, if it’s heads, then “i don’t even” and if it’s tails, then it’s “fucking know man.” This by all accounts should be a regular season classic. Dallas +0.5 









**Week 7: BYE**



Honestly we lose this week, having a bye this early is terrible








**Week 8: LAR @ DAL**





Trevon Diggs v. Cooper Kupp. Micah Parsons against Matt Stafford. A bunch of other people that will have their jersey’s framed behind them in their office at the car dealership next year Versus A star studded Dallas team. Just like the Vikings last year, this may be my favorite game of the regular season , because we might win by 30 









**Week 9: DAL @ PHI**






We are for sure going to win one of these this season. Probably not the one where we are gonna get pelted by batteries and clever insults bordering on but not quite encroaching on racial slurs. Going into Philly is going to be tough for anyone this year. I hate you fuckers, but I deeply respect y’all. Dallas +2.5






**Week 10: NYG @ DAL**







The New York Giants had no business going 9-7-1 last year, and over achieved in almost every facet you could have imagined. That being said, Eli signed our stadium when ya’ll beat us when we opened the stadium in 2015, so we’ll cover the spread and this will be the game where every Giants fan understands why the front office didn’t sign Saquon to a long term deal like we did with Zeke, and will be a turning point with Mazi- either he will be the reason Saquon sucks this game, or it will be when we realize that the post season will be awfully familiar this year 









**Week 11: DAL @ CAR**






With all due respect, i don’t know how to say this, unless C.J. Stroud has a rookie RG3 year, i  don’t know how to not be a bit disrespectful here. Carolina has all the potential in the world going into the future, but i would not be shocked of they ended up with a top 5 pick this next draft. That being said we absolutely lose this game for no reason at all other than fuck you, Dallas fan, signed and sincerely, god himself. My estimated spread doesn’t matter when the football gods want to play fuck fuck games. 








**Week 12: WFT @ DAL**











Everybody’s newest not least favorite team, the Washington {redacted} football team commanders are going all in on Sam Howell, and my prediction is that if Howell is still the QB at this point, they steamroll us on the way to an NFC East championship. Definitely going to be a fantastic under bet regardless, but i see Dallas at +2.5 this week






**Week 13: SEA @ DAL**








We got their former OC and OL coach, and a Geno Vr. Dak duel just feels right in general. If Geno can continue his accession, this will be must see TV, if Geno is what we all thought he was before last year, this will be a bad week for anybody that was 12 in 2012. Dallas- 4.5









**Week 14 : PHI @ DAL**






After a dog fight in week 9, both teams will be eager for a rematch with each other in week 14 , in a game that I imagine will have massively important playoff implications. Mazi’s ability to make the 92% conversion rate of Philly’s 3rd and 4th and less than 2 is going to be put in the spotlight more so than he has ever experienced before.   Dallas - 2.5, if and only if we have that dog at DT





**Week 15: DAL @ BUF**






If movies have Oscar bait, than this game is prime time bait if there ever was prime time bait. If things are going the way they should go, than this is not an unreasonable candidate for a super bowl preview. Because it’s the Bills, we will lose the regular season game because we will always handle them in the post season, just like we will win against the 49ers in the regular season but will most assuredly lose if we meet in the post season. Bills win by virtue of a Wide Left by whoever is our kicker, Cowboys +1.5







**Week 16: DAL @ MIA**





Tua has the same odds as making it to this game as Tyron Smith does. Mike White drops 300 a d 4 td’s on us, Cowboys win 34- 28,







**Week 17: DET @ DAL**








This is the game where Detroit locks in 2nd place in the NFC North, Cowboys -3.5 in a game that is going to a brutal back and forth







**Week 18: DAL @ WFT**





This game will not matter, as both tams, for better or for worse, will have locked up their post season standings. We are talking about some real degenerate Jacoby Brisset vr. Cooper Rush shit. Cowboys -.5







Pulled out my ass prediction for the season is 12-5 and a wildcard spot in the post season, inevitably losing to the gold diggers in the NFC Championship game, probably on an embarrassing last play

&gt;“Was able to stay consistent with all the things that I normally would do,” Bosa said. “But the key to gaining weight is just to eat a lot. Eat way more than you want to. And it's no fun a lot of the time.”

&gt;Before a morning run, Bosa would drink plenty of fluids, maybe eat a little fruit. He’d follow his run with a small breakfast.

&gt;Then, the eating marathon would commence.

&gt;Five more meals with plates full of red meat, chicken or fish. A big dose of protein, some vegetables and often a version of his guilty-pleasure carbohydrates, like chickpea pasta.

&gt;And snacks. Lots of snacks -- think pretzels, nuts and fruit (But no honeydew or cantaloupe, which Bosa despises) -- often smothered in creamy peanut butter. And a smoothie.

&gt;“I'll just eat berries in the peanut butter because my chef in Florida said that the fruit, you need a fat with the fruit for it to really have its whatever benefit,” Bosa said. “So that helps with the weight gain and getting all the vitamins and stuff from the fruit.”
