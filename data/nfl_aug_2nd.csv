# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

Group | Roster | PFF Ranking | My Expectation | Deep? | High Variance?
-----|--------|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

However, I feel duty bound to let you know that Mayfield is not running away with this QB competition like it seems literally everyone is assuming. All reports from local reporters is that Mayfield cannot stop turning the ball over and is worse for new OC Dave Canales’ scheme overall while Trask looks more mobile and is taking care of the ball.

Still early in camp of course, but I’ve seen people on here (and even national reporters who clearly aren’t actually following along) say it’s not even a competition for Mayfield when that’s clearly not the case if you’re paying attention.",t5_2qmg3
8,"NFL considers alternatives to the kickoff, including the XFL model",nfl,"&gt;In the XFL, the kick happens at the 30 yard line. Other than the kicker, the players on the kicking team are aligned at the receiving team’s 35 yard line. Ten of the receiving team’s players are positioned five yards away. Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players. The XFL rule leaves only five yards of space for players to cover before contact, keeping them from getting to top speed.

&gt;Switching to the XFL approach wouldn’t be an easy sell. One source with extensive knowledge and experience coaching special teams predicts it will be an “ugly play,” with the kick returner getting “crushed.”

&gt;“They have no idea how much different NFL players are,” the source said. “There will literally be nowhere to run.”",t5_2qmg3

11,"The only quarterbacks ranked ahead of Kirk Cousins for the NFL Top 100 from the 2022-2023 season are Herbert, Allen, Hurts, Burrow, and Mahomes. Is that a fair ranking?",nfl,"Reminder that the top 100 is based off of a poll of NFL players voting on their peers *based on the most recent NFL season.* This is not a ranking of the best players going into the next season. This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

Wasn’t a perfect player, could get swallowed up in run defense, but I think one of the biggest questions that people had was what would he look like without that dominant Georgia d-line in front of him. That question is not going to be answered this year.

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

-----|--------|-----------|--------------|-----|--------------

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

However, I feel duty bound to let you know that Mayfield is not running away with this QB competition like it seems literally everyone is assuming. All reports from local reporters is that Mayfield cannot stop turning the ball over and is worse for new OC Dave Canales’ scheme overall while Trask looks more mobile and is taking care of the ball.

108,"NFL considers alternatives to the kickoff, including the XFL model",nfl,"&gt;In the XFL, the kick happens at the 30 yard line. Other than the kicker, the players on the kicking team are aligned at the receiving team’s 35 yard line. Ten of the receiving team’s players are positioned five yards away. Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players. The XFL rule leaves only five yards of space for players to cover before contact, keeping them from getting to top speed.

&gt;Switching to the XFL approach wouldn’t be an easy sell. One source with extensive knowledge and experience coaching special teams predicts it will be an “ugly play,” with the kick returner getting “crushed.”

&gt;“They have no idea how much different NFL players are,” the source said. “There will literally be nowhere to run.”",t5_2qmg3

111,"The only quarterbacks ranked ahead of Kirk Cousins for the NFL Top 100 from the 2022-2023 season are Herbert, Allen, Hurts, Burrow, and Mahomes. Is that a fair ranking?",nfl,"Reminder that the top 100 is based off of a poll of NFL players voting on their peers *based on the most recent NFL season.* This is not a ranking of the best players going into the next season. This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

201,2023 Offseason Review: San Francisco 49ers,nfl,"#San Francisco 49ers Offseason Review

##[Series Hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/14cr8hj/offseason_review_series_call_for_writers_and/)

---
##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

208,"NFL considers alternatives to the kickoff, including the XFL model",nfl,"&gt;In the XFL, the kick happens at the 30 yard line. Other than the kicker, the players on the kicking team are aligned at the receiving team’s 35 yard line. Ten of the receiving team’s players are positioned five yards away. Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players. The XFL rule leaves only five yards of space for players to cover before contact, keeping them from getting to top speed.

&gt;Switching to the XFL approach wouldn’t be an easy sell. One source with extensive knowledge and experience coaching special teams predicts it will be an “ugly play,” with the kick returner getting “crushed.”

&gt;“They have no idea how much different NFL players are,” the source said. “There will literally be nowhere to run.”",t5_2qmg3

211,"The only quarterbacks ranked ahead of Kirk Cousins for the NFL Top 100 from the 2022-2023 season are Herbert, Allen, Hurts, Burrow, and Mahomes. Is that a fair ranking?",nfl,"Reminder that the top 100 is based off of a poll of NFL players voting on their peers *based on the most recent NFL season.* This is not a ranking of the best players going into the next season. This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

That question is not going to be answered this year.

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

301,2023 Offseason Review: San Francisco 49ers,nfl,"#San Francisco 49ers Offseason Review

##[Series Hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/14cr8hj/offseason_review_series_call_for_writers_and/)

---
##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

However, I feel duty bound to let you know that Mayfield is not running away with this QB competition like it seems literally everyone is assuming. All reports from local reporters is that Mayfield cannot stop turning the ball over and is worse for new OC Dave Canales’ scheme overall while Trask looks more mobile and is taking care of the ball.

308,"NFL considers alternatives to the kickoff, including the XFL model",nfl,"&gt;In the XFL, the kick happens at the 30 yard line. Other than the kicker, the players on the kicking team are aligned at the receiving team’s 35 yard line. Ten of the receiving team’s players are positioned five yards away. Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players. The XFL rule leaves only five yards of space for players to cover before contact, keeping them from getting to top speed.

&gt;Switching to the XFL approach wouldn’t be an easy sell. One source with extensive knowledge and experience coaching special teams predicts it will be an “ugly play,” with the kick returner getting “crushed.”

&gt;“They have no idea how much different NFL players are,” the source said. “There will literally be nowhere to run.”",t5_2qmg3

311,"The only quarterbacks ranked ahead of Kirk Cousins for the NFL Top 100 from the 2022-2023 season are Herbert, Allen, Hurts, Burrow, and Mahomes. Is that a fair ranking?",nfl,"Reminder that the top 100 is based off of a poll of NFL players voting on their peers *based on the most recent NFL season.* This is not a ranking of the best players going into the next season. This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

That question is not going to be answered this year.

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

408,"NFL considers alternatives to the kickoff, including the XFL model",nfl,"&gt;In the XFL, the kick happens at the 30 yard line. Other than the kicker, the players on the kicking team are aligned at the receiving team’s 35 yard line. Ten of the receiving team’s players are positioned five yards away. Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players. The XFL rule leaves only five yards of space for players to cover before contact, keeping them from getting to top speed.

&gt;Switching to the XFL approach wouldn’t be an easy sell. One source with extensive knowledge and experience coaching special teams predicts it will be an “ugly play,” with the kick returner getting “crushed.”

This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

Undersized dude, but was a pretty dynamic player at Georgia who really showed out as a blitzer and run defender and offered upside in coverage as well. Wasn’t a perfect player, could get swallowed up in run defense, but I think one of the biggest questions that people had was what would he look like without that dominant Georgia d-line in front of him. That question is not going to be answered this year.

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

508,"NFL considers alternatives to the kickoff, including the XFL model",nfl,"&gt;In the XFL, the kick happens at the 30 yard line. Other than the kicker, the players on the kicking team are aligned at the receiving team’s 35 yard line. Ten of the receiving team’s players are positioned five yards away. Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players. The XFL rule leaves only five yards of space for players to cover before contact, keeping them from getting to top speed.

&gt;Switching to the XFL approach wouldn’t be an easy sell. One source with extensive knowledge and experience coaching special teams predicts it will be an “ugly play,” with the kick returner getting “crushed.”

This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

&gt;All of a sudden, Reddick is now tied (with Nwosu) for the 15th-highest salary by average per year ($15 million), according to Over The Cap. He has two years remaining on his original deal. The league's top-paid edge rusher, the Steelers' T.J. Watt, makes nearly double that.",t5_2qmg3

I’m not missing it at all.”",nfl,"&gt;""This is going to be a few-years partnership,"" Rodgers said Tuesday, explaining his rationale for taking a historic $35 million pay cut in a newly restructured contract.

&gt;He wants the team to remain competitive in the future because he doesn't expect to be a one-and-done player for the Jets.

&gt;""I want to play a few more years, and it'll be five after that,"" said the four-time NFL MVP, alluding to the mandatory waiting period for eligibility. ""Who knows what's going to happen in eight or nine years? That's a long way off."" Rodgers also said, ""I'm taking it one year at a time.

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

Wasn’t a perfect player, could get swallowed up in run defense, but I think one of the biggest questions that people had was what would he look like without that dominant Georgia d-line in front of him. That question is not going to be answered this year.

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players. The XFL rule leaves only five yards of space for players to cover before contact, keeping them from getting to top speed.

&gt;Switching to the XFL approach wouldn’t be an easy sell. One source with extensive knowledge and experience coaching special teams predicts it will be an “ugly play,” with the kick returner getting “crushed.”

This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

&gt;According to Story County authorities in the Register report, Uwazurike is alleged to have bet on the Cyclones’ contests with Iowa and Kansas. Further, according to the Register, “The criminal complaint alleges he placed 32 wagers on Broncos games and players.”

&gt;Uwazurike is one of four current or former ISU athletes accused by Story County authorities in this probe. One of the others is the Cyclones’ starting quarterback, Hunter Dekker.

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

Wasn’t a perfect player, could get swallowed up in run defense, but I think one of the biggest questions that people had was what would he look like without that dominant Georgia d-line in front of him. That question is not going to be answered this year.

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

That question is not going to be answered this year.

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3

This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.
