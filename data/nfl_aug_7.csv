1,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|
|Leonard Fournette|RB|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review
* NFL is considering adopting the XFL’s kickoff style

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.77,,False,1691414030.0
30,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Andrew Adams|S|UFA|N/a
|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

**Players Re-Signed**

|Player|Position|Length|Salary

|Jeffery Simmons|DT|4-Year Extension|$23.5 Million

|Nick Westbrook-Ikhine|WR|1-year RFA tender|$1.26 Million
|Naquan Jones|DT|1-year RFA tender|$940k

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

|Chris Moore|WR|Houston Texans|1 Year|$1.3 Million
|Trevon Wesco|TE|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$1.2 Million
|Chris Hubbard|RT|Cleveland Browns|1 Year|???

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023.

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

101,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review
* NFL is considering adopting the XFL’s kickoff style

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.77,,False,1691414030.0
130,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

|Naquan Jones|DT|1-year RFA tender|$940k

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

|Chris Moore|WR|Houston Texans|1 Year|$1.3 Million
|Trevon Wesco|TE|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$1.2 Million
|Chris Hubbard|RT|Cleveland Browns|1 Year|???

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

201,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|

|Ryan Succop|K|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

229,NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review
* NFL is considering adopting the XFL’s kickoff style

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub!

230,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

301,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|
|Leonard Fournette|RB|Free Agent|
|Julio Jones|WR|Free Agent|
|Scotty Miller|WR|Atlanta Falcons|

|Keanu Neal|FS|Pittsburgh Steelers|
|Logan Ryan|SS|Free Agent|
|Ryan Succop|K|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

329,NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review
* NFL is considering adopting the XFL’s kickoff style

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.8,,False,1691414030.0
330,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

401,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|
|Leonard Fournette|RB|Free Agent|
|Julio Jones|WR|Free Agent|
|Scotty Miller|WR|Atlanta Falcons|

|Mike Edwards|SS|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Keanu Neal|FS|Pittsburgh Steelers|
|Logan Ryan|SS|Free Agent|
|Ryan Succop|K|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

429,NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review
* NFL is considering adopting the XFL’s kickoff style

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.79,,False,1691414030.0
430,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

501,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|
|Leonard Fournette|RB|Free Agent|
|Julio Jones|WR|Free Agent|
|Scotty Miller|WR|Atlanta Falcons|

|Sean Murphy-Bunting|CB|Tennessee Titans|
|Mike Edwards|SS|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Keanu Neal|FS|Pittsburgh Steelers|
|Logan Ryan|SS|Free Agent|
|Ryan Succop|K|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

529,NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review
* NFL is considering adopting the XFL’s kickoff style

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.8,,False,1691414030.0
530,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

601,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|
|Leonard Fournette|RB|Free Agent|
|Julio Jones|WR|Free Agent|
|Scotty Miller|WR|Atlanta Falcons|

|Keanu Neal|FS|Pittsburgh Steelers|
|Logan Ryan|SS|Free Agent|
|Ryan Succop|K|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

629,NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review
* NFL is considering adopting the XFL’s kickoff style

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.84,,False,1691414030.0
630,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

701,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|
|Leonard Fournette|RB|Free Agent|
|Julio Jones|WR|Free Agent|
|Scotty Miller|WR|Atlanta Falcons|

|Keanu Neal|FS|Pittsburgh Steelers|
|Logan Ryan|SS|Free Agent|
|Ryan Succop|K|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

729,NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.77,,False,1691414030.0
730,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.83,,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

801,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|
|Leonard Fournette|RB|Free Agent|
|Julio Jones|WR|Free Agent|
|Scotty Miller|WR|Atlanta Falcons|

|Keanu Neal|FS|Pittsburgh Steelers|
|Logan Ryan|SS|Free Agent|
|Ryan Succop|K|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

829,NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.84,,False,1691414030.0
830,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

901,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tom Brady|QB|Fox Sports|
|Blaine Gabbert|QB|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Giovani Bernard|RB|Retired|
|Leonard Fournette|RB|Free Agent|
|Julio Jones|WR|Free Agent|
|Scotty Miller|WR|Atlanta Falcons|

|Mike Edwards|SS|Kansas City Chiefs|
|Keanu Neal|FS|Pittsburgh Steelers|
|Logan Ryan|SS|Free Agent|
|Ryan Succop|K|Free Agent|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

929,NFL Recap: 07/31/2023 - 08/06/2023,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

* Former NFL LB Blake Martinez has reportedly been permanently banned from reselling Pokemon cards on Whatnot for scamming collectors
* NFL changed Personal Conduct Policy to say cooperation does not equal mitigation because that was a key factor in a reduced suspension for QB Deshaun Watson last year
* QB Johnny Manziel revealed that he attempted suicide after being cut by the Browns
* Deion Sanders proposed that the Hall of Fame have an “upper room”
* NFL’s new rule against giving players and employees equity could be a collusion/antitrust violation
* Lights went out during HOF game and showers did not work after the game
* NFL now has the ability to investigate players for things that happened before being drafted in the NFL
* Turnover on downs is now subject to automatic review
* NFL is considering adopting the XFL’s kickoff style

**Featured Team of the Week: Buffalo Bills**

\*see links at link in bio

These are on sale now and could be a good internal layer for those cold games in the winter and warm enough by itself for those early season games. Grab one at the [link](http://fanatics.93n6tx.net/BillsNikePull) while they are still being sold at a reduced price!

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.79,,False,1691414030.0
930,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.82,,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

*All of the links in the table go to the official /r/TennesseeTitans discussion thread for each pick.*

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

-------------

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**
