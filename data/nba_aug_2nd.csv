3,Which players legacy is most impacted if their first name was ‘Bob’?,nba,"Off-season post obviously, some I thought of:

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

36,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes. For example, in 2023 if Joel Embiid received 50 out of 100 first place MVP votes (i'm just making these numbers up), that would be 0.5 MVP shares. Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|
|4.|Larry Bird*|5.612|
|5.|Magic Johnson*|5.104|
|6.|Bill Russell*|4.748|
|7.|Shaquille ONeal*|4.380|
|8.|Karl Malone*|4.296|
|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12.|James Harden|3.656|
|13.|Julius Erving*|3.551|
|14.|Giannis Antetokounmpo|3.511|
|15.|Kevin Durant|3.210|
|16.|David Robinson*|3.123|
|17.|Moses Malone*|2.854|
|18.|Mel Daniels*|2.795|
|19.|Kevin Garnett*|2.753|
|20.|Nikola Jokic|2.738|
|21.|Bob Pettit*|2.671|

|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|
|25.|Charles Barkley*|2.437|




Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

37,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

Kobe has to set up the offense, read the defense, make others happy and he's doing a great job of it. Kobe has become the floor leader on a basketball team that was looking for that player who can not only be a scorer, but also be a playmaker who can consistently make big plays at critical times. It was very important for Kobe to step into that role he was envisioned at.""

60,"What is the most memorable play, event, or photo/clip from a game you attended in person?",nba,"The very first NBA game that I attended in person was in Feb of 1997.  I was a teenager, and we had standing room only tickets to see the Bulls play the GSW at the United Center.  I was on crutches and didn't realize I probably could've gotten some seating accomadation if I asked, so instead I hung out with my buddies STANDING the entire game behind the last row of the 300 section.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

It later became a famous picture that many may recognize: https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/8/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/3/dennis-rodman-diving-for-loose-ball-sam-forencich.jpg

Since then I've been to a lot of games, and been fortunate enough to sit courtside, under the basket, and in far better seats.  There have been some cool occurances in those games, but that first memory and the resulting photo/clip that became pretty noteworthy always stick in my mind as a highlight.

72,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s
73,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success.

Before 2018, the last time the average NBA player was under 6'7"" was 1979. Close to the same year the ABA died. Body weights have trended upward continuously since the league started. From 195 in 1951, and peaked at 223 pounds in 2010. It plateau'd there for several years and begun trending downward, as we can see, in 2015. In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

103,Which players legacy is most impacted if their first name was ‘Bob’?,nba,"Off-season post obviously, some I thought of:

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares

137,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

172,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.

173,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success. 

That’s my take, but what do you guys think?",t5_2qo4s

186,Random Fact: NBA players have been shrinking for the last 8 years.,nba,"[Average League Heights and Weights Per BBall-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html)

Year denotes when the season began:

2014: 6'7"" 223

2015: 6'7"" 222

2016: 6'7"" 221

2017: 6'7"" 220

2018: 6'6"" 219

2019: 6'6"" 218

2020: 6'6"" 217

2021: 6'6"" 215

2022: 6'7"" 216

Before 2018, the last time the average NBA player was under 6'7"" was 1979. Close to the same year the ABA died. Body weights have trended upward continuously since the league started. From 195 in 1951, and peaked at 223 pounds in 2010. It plateau'd there for several years and begun trending downward, as we can see, in 2015. In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

I'm surprised this hasn't been treated as an emergency given the way some of y'all like to ride players. But seriously, what may be causing this shrinkage?",t5_2qo4s

203,Which players legacy is most impacted if their first name was ‘Bob’?,nba,"Off-season post obviously, some I thought of:

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

I haven't seen much discussion of the fact that the Magic have been making political contributions to politicians for 25 years. These aren't contributions by the owners; they're contributions directly from the team.

Since 1997, the Magic have made [279 donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=orlando+magic&amp;order=desc&amp;sort=D) to political campaigns--either to candidate PACs, super pacs, or political parties.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

236,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes.

Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|
|4.|Larry Bird*|5.612|
|5.|Magic Johnson*|5.104|
|6.|Bill Russell*|4.748|
|7.|Shaquille ONeal*|4.380|
|8.|Karl Malone*|4.296|
|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12.|James Harden|3.656|
|13.|Julius Erving*|3.551|
|14.|Giannis Antetokounmpo|3.511|

|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|
|25.|Charles Barkley*|2.437|




Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

237,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

I was on crutches and didn't realize I probably could've gotten some seating accomadation if I asked, so instead I hung out with my buddies STANDING the entire game behind the last row of the 300 section.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

It later became a famous picture that many may recognize: https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/8/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/3/dennis-rodman-diving-for-loose-ball-sam-forencich.jpg

Since then I've been to a lot of games, and been fortunate enough to sit courtside, under the basket, and in far better seats.

272,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s
273,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success.

In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

295,What percentage of fans actually watch 82 games a year?,nba,"I generally watch around 75 regular season games (I’m bound to miss a few), and then almost all playoff games.  I personally don’t know anyone else who does this and it’s kind of a bummer because all my guys friends are obsessed with football (I watch a ton of college and some NFL also).  

Does anyone else have this issue that none of their close friends really care about basketball as much as they do?",t5_2qo4s
296,"Who is better ALL-TIME and at their peaks?: Russell Westbrook, Gary Payton, or Walt Fraizer?",nba,"Russell Westbrook = MVP, Triple double leader (multiple times), scoring champ, assists champ, 1x finals appearance. Unfortunately, wasn’t able to capitalize in the playoffs multiple times.

Walt Fraizer = Multiple all-nba defensive first teams, 2x champion, 7x all star, was phenomenal in Knicks playoffs runs.

Gary Payton = DPOY, 9x all star, steals leader, multiple finals appearances, took the goat to six games, 1x champ (as a role player), easily the best defensively out of the 3.

Thoughts?",t5_2qo4s

298,What are the greatest (or worst) offseason posts in r/NBA's history?,nba,My personal favorite is one where someone asked if a player can kiss another player as a way to get into their head.,t5_2qo4s
299,Who was the most important player on the 2014 Spurs?,nba,"I haven't been an NBA fan for too long, and whenever I hear about this team it's usually about how they played really good team basketball. Looking *purely at the regular season and playoff* [*statistics*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAS/2014.html)*,* it seems as if it's a three-way tie between Tim, Tony, and Kawhi. However, I know statistics don't tell the whole story, and Tim and Kawhi were probably much better defensive players than Tony. It was clearly more of Tim and Tony's team in 2013 before Kawhi really took over in 2015. 2014 seems more like that transition year.",t5_2qo4s

303,Which players legacy is most impacted if their first name was ‘Bob’?,nba,"Off-season post obviously, some I thought of:

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

They've once again recovered post-PG and seem poised to create another great team, but man, has any other well-run org in the NBA had this much bad luck in getting a ring?",t5_2qo4s

336,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes. For example, in 2023 if Joel Embiid received 50 out of 100 first place MVP votes (i'm just making these numbers up), that would be 0.5 MVP shares. Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|
|4.|Larry Bird*|5.612|
|5.|Magic Johnson*|5.104|
|6.|Bill Russell*|4.748|

|8.|Karl Malone*|4.296|
|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12.|James Harden|3.656|
|13.|Julius Erving*|3.551|
|14.|Giannis Antetokounmpo|3.511|

|16.|David Robinson*|3.123|
|17.|Moses Malone*|2.854|

|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|
|25.|Charles Barkley*|2.437|




Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

337,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

The game is available to watch on League Pass, and it’s a pretty interesting watch. To get Kerr running point, leading the broadcast, analyzing the Splash Bros &amp; KD in the same game.

Kerr being enthralled by Steph Curry, and how he excites the crowd in this game is pretty cool. Kerr was a huge fan before he ever coached him. He called the Warriors fans among the best in sports. He was also quite complimentary towards Mark Jackson's coaching.

Do you guys remember watching this when it happened?

Kobe has to set up the offense, read the defense, make others happy and he's doing a great job of it. Kobe has become the floor leader on a basketball team that was looking for that player who can not only be a scorer, but also be a playmaker who can consistently make big plays at critical times.

I was a teenager, and we had standing room only tickets to see the Bulls play the GSW at the United Center.  I was on crutches and didn't realize I probably could've gotten some seating accomadation if I asked, so instead I hung out with my buddies STANDING the entire game behind the last row of the 300 section.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

It later became a famous picture that many may recognize: https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/8/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/3/dennis-rodman-diving-for-loose-ball-sam-forencich.jpg

Since then I've been to a lot of games, and been fortunate enough to sit courtside, under the basket, and in far better seats.

372,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s
373,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success.

In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

436,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes.

Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|
|4.|Larry Bird*|5.612|
|5.|Magic Johnson*|5.104|
|6.|Bill Russell*|4.748|
|7.|Shaquille ONeal*|4.380|
|8.|Karl Malone*|4.296|
|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12.|James Harden|3.656|
|13.|Julius Erving*|3.551|
|14.|Giannis Antetokounmpo|3.511|

|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|

Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

437,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

Lastly, tagging /u/konsf_ksd here since they’d inquired about the full list on said earlier comment that I made on the original post.",t5_2qo4s

472,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s
473,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success. 

That’s my take, but what do you guys think?",t5_2qo4s

2021: 6'6"" 215

2022: 6'7"" 216

Before 2018, the last time the average NBA player was under 6'7"" was 1979. Close to the same year the ABA died. Body weights have trended upward continuously since the league started. From 195 in 1951, and peaked at 223 pounds in 2010. It plateau'd there for several years and begun trending downward, as we can see, in 2015. In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

I'm surprised this hasn't been treated as an emergency given the way some of y'all like to ride players. But seriously, what may be causing this shrinkage?",t5_2qo4s

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

Since 1997, the Magic have made [279 donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=orlando+magic&amp;order=desc&amp;sort=D) to political campaigns--either to candidate PACs, super pacs, or political parties.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

536,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes.

Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|

|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|

|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|
|25.|Charles Barkley*|2.437|




Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

537,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

Kerr being enthralled by Steph Curry, and how he excites the crowd in this game is pretty cool. Kerr was a huge fan before he ever coached him. He called the Warriors fans among the best in sports. He was also quite complimentary towards Mark Jackson's coaching.

I was on crutches and didn't realize I probably could've gotten some seating accomadation if I asked, so instead I hung out with my buddies STANDING the entire game behind the last row of the 300 section.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

It later became a famous picture that many may recognize: https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/8/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/3/dennis-rodman-diving-for-loose-ball-sam-forencich.jpg

Since then I've been to a lot of games, and been fortunate enough to sit courtside, under the basket, and in far better seats.

572,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s
573,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success.

586,Random Fact: NBA players have been shrinking for the last 8 years.,nba,"[Average League Heights and Weights Per BBall-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html)

Year denotes when the season began:

2014: 6'7"" 223

2015: 6'7"" 222

2016: 6'7"" 221

2017: 6'7"" 220

2018: 6'6"" 219

2019: 6'6"" 218

2020: 6'6"" 217

2021: 6'6"" 215

2022: 6'7"" 216

Before 2018, the last time the average NBA player was under 6'7"" was 1979. Close to the same year the ABA died. Body weights have trended upward continuously since the league started. From 195 in 1951, and peaked at 223 pounds in 2010. It plateau'd there for several years and begun trending downward, as we can see, in 2015. In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

I'm surprised this hasn't been treated as an emergency given the way some of y'all like to ride players. But seriously, what may be causing this shrinkage?",t5_2qo4s
587,"Who’s better right now, KD or Booker?",nba,"Personally I think Booker is better right now and going forward because of the rim pressure he’s able to provide vs KD who has become extremely reliant on his mid range J.

I do think they’re right next to each other as far as rankings.

&gt;The deals are not finalized, but are quickly moving in that direction.

&gt;This has left Jackson in peril.

&gt;Sources said Jackson could stay on and join play-by-player Mark Jones on the network’s second team. If he balks at that option, he could be headed out of ESPN.

Walt Fraizer = Multiple all-nba defensive first teams, 2x champion, 7x all star, was phenomenal in Knicks playoffs runs.

Gary Payton = DPOY, 9x all star, steals leader, multiple finals appearances, took the goat to six games, 1x champ (as a role player), easily the best defensively out of the 3.

Looking *purely at the regular season and playoff* [*statistics*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAS/2014.html)*,* it seems as if it's a three-way tie between Tim, Tony, and Kawhi. However, I know statistics don't tell the whole story, and Tim and Kawhi were probably much better defensive players than Tony. It was clearly more of Tim and Tony's team in 2013 before Kawhi really took over in 2015. 2014 seems more like that transition year.",t5_2qo4s

Started cussing him out…This dude is a major trash-talker. … So I guess the rumor is that Brad Beal and him were squaring off 1-on-1 and Brad Beal was taking it lightly. It’s a high school kid.

603,Which players legacy is most impacted if their first name was ‘Bob’?,nba,"Off-season post obviously, some I thought of:

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

I haven't seen much discussion of the fact that the Magic have been making political contributions to politicians for 25 years. These aren't contributions by the owners; they're contributions directly from the team.

Since 1997, the Magic have made [279 donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=orlando+magic&amp;order=desc&amp;sort=D) to political campaigns--either to candidate PACs, super pacs, or political parties. The vast majority of these contributions have been to Republicans, and nearly all of them have been to Florida politicians.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

636,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes.

Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|
|4.|Larry Bird*|5.612|
|5.|Magic Johnson*|5.104|
|6.|Bill Russell*|4.748|

|8.|Karl Malone*|4.296|
|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12.|James Harden|3.656|
|13.|Julius Erving*|3.551|

|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|
|25.|Charles Barkley*|2.437|




Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

637,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

Kerr being enthralled by Steph Curry, and how he excites the crowd in this game is pretty cool. Kerr was a huge fan before he ever coached him. He called the Warriors fans among the best in sports. He was also quite complimentary towards Mark Jackson's coaching.

I was a teenager, and we had standing room only tickets to see the Bulls play the GSW at the United Center.  I was on crutches and didn't realize I probably could've gotten some seating accomadation if I asked, so instead I hung out with my buddies STANDING the entire game behind the last row of the 300 section.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

It later became a famous picture that many may recognize: https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/8/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/3/dennis-rodman-diving-for-loose-ball-sam-forencich.jpg

Since then I've been to a lot of games, and been fortunate enough to sit courtside, under the basket, and in far better seats.

672,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s
673,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success.

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

736,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes. For example, in 2023 if Joel Embiid received 50 out of 100 first place MVP votes (i'm just making these numbers up), that would be 0.5 MVP shares. Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|
|4.|Larry Bird*|5.612|
|5.|Magic Johnson*|5.104|
|6.|Bill Russell*|4.748|
|7.|Shaquille ONeal*|4.380|
|8.|Karl Malone*|4.296|
|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12.|James Harden|3.656|
|13.|Julius Erving*|3.551|
|14.|Giannis Antetokounmpo|3.511|
|15.|Kevin Durant|3.210|
|16.|David Robinson*|3.123|
|17.|Moses Malone*|2.854|
|18.|Mel Daniels*|2.795|
|19.|Kevin Garnett*|2.753|
|20.|Nikola Jokic|2.738|
|21.|Bob Pettit*|2.671|
|22.|Stephen Curry|2.664|
|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|
|25.|Charles Barkley*|2.437|




Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

737,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

760,"What is the most memorable play, event, or photo/clip from a game you attended in person?",nba,"The very first NBA game that I attended in person was in Feb of 1997.  I was a teenager, and we had standing room only tickets to see the Bulls play the GSW at the United Center.  I was on crutches and didn't realize I probably could've gotten some seating accomadation if I asked, so instead I hung out with my buddies STANDING the entire game behind the last row of the 300 section.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

It later became a famous picture that many may recognize: https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/8/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/3/dennis-rodman-diving-for-loose-ball-sam-forencich.jpg

Since then I've been to a lot of games, and been fortunate enough to sit courtside, under the basket, and in far better seats.  There have been some cool occurances in those games, but that first memory and the resulting photo/clip that became pretty noteworthy always stick in my mind as a highlight.

772,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s
773,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success. 

That’s my take, but what do you guys think?",t5_2qo4s

2022: 6'7"" 216

Before 2018, the last time the average NBA player was under 6'7"" was 1979. Close to the same year the ABA died. Body weights have trended upward continuously since the league started. From 195 in 1951, and peaked at 223 pounds in 2010. It plateau'd there for several years and begun trending downward, as we can see, in 2015. In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

803,Which players legacy is most impacted if their first name was ‘Bob’?,nba,"Off-season post obviously, some I thought of:

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|

837,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

Kerr being enthralled by Steph Curry, and how he excites the crowd in this game is pretty cool. Kerr was a huge fan before he ever coached him. He called the Warriors fans among the best in sports. He was also quite complimentary towards Mark Jackson's coaching.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

872,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.

873,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success. 

That’s my take, but what do you guys think?",t5_2qo4s

886,Random Fact: NBA players have been shrinking for the last 8 years.,nba,"[Average League Heights and Weights Per BBall-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html)

Year denotes when the season began:

2014: 6'7"" 223

2015: 6'7"" 222

2016: 6'7"" 221

2017: 6'7"" 220

2018: 6'6"" 219

2019: 6'6"" 218

2020: 6'6"" 217

2021: 6'6"" 215

2022: 6'7"" 216

Before 2018, the last time the average NBA player was under 6'7"" was 1979. Close to the same year the ABA died. Body weights have trended upward continuously since the league started. From 195 in 1951, and peaked at 223 pounds in 2010. It plateau'd there for several years and begun trending downward, as we can see, in 2015. In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

I'm surprised this hasn't been treated as an emergency given the way some of y'all like to ride players. But seriously, what may be causing this shrinkage?",t5_2qo4s

903,Which players legacy is most impacted if their first name was ‘Bob’?,nba,"Off-season post obviously, some I thought of:

LeBron James - His name is now Bob James, he can’t go by LeBron anymore. Maybe he still gets the King James nickname but losing LeBron hurts him a lot

Michael Jordan - Now instead of MJ, he’d be BJ, don’t think that would be as popular. Could still go by Air Jordan though 

Bol Bol - Is now Bob Bol and that just means he has bad hands, not such a good name. Does he even make the league with less meme potential?

Magic Johnson - Technically Magic is not his name but if he actually went by Bob Johnson he both loses an amazing nickname and ends up with an incredibly generic name

It was also a warning to other players and agents.

&gt;The Heat have been working on a trade package of expiring deals, three to four first-round picks and one of the team’s younger players, with Tyler Herro going to a third team. The deal could potentially also involve second-rounders and draft pick swaps, according to sources.

I haven't seen much discussion of the fact that the Magic have been making political contributions to politicians for 25 years. These aren't contributions by the owners; they're contributions directly from the team.

Since 1997, the Magic have made [279 donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=orlando+magic&amp;order=desc&amp;sort=D) to political campaigns--either to candidate PACs, super pacs, or political parties.

In the 90s, they had a solid team behind Reggie Miller, but were consistently stopped by all-time greats like Ewing's Knicks, Penny/Shaq Magic, and of course Jordan's Bulls. They get Larry Bird as their coach and finally make the Finals, only to hit ANOTHER brickwall in the form of the Kobe/Shaq Lakers.

They recover and build an even greater team around Reggie, only to get it crippled in the Malice. Then they rebuild a NEW TEAM led by Paul George, only to unfortunately blossom during the LeBron era.

936,Looking at career MVP Award Shares gives a shockingly good list for the top 10 players ever,nba,"MVP Award share is simply the number of 1st place votes that a player received for the MVP award over the total points of all first-placed votes.

Steph Curry's unanimous MVP season would be 1.0 award shares. 

Here is the top 10 players ever in MVP award shares 


|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.|LeBron James|8.815|
|2.|Michael Jordan*|8.115|
|3.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|6.105|
|4.|Larry Bird*|5.612|
|5.|Magic Johnson*|5.104|
|6.|Bill Russell*|4.748|
|7.|Shaquille ONeal*|4.380|
|8.|Karl Malone*|4.296|
|9.|Tim Duncan*|4.278|
|10.|Kobe Bryant*|4.202|
|11.|Wilt Chamberlain*|4.152|


This is a shockingly good list for just 1 metric. The top 11 basically consists of the 10 players that make up most people's top 10 + Karl Malone. Here's the rest of the top 25



|Rank|Player|MVP Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12.|James Harden|3.656|
|13.|Julius Erving*|3.551|
|14.|Giannis Antetokounmpo|3.511|

|23.|Hakeem Olajuwon*|2.610|
|24.|Oscar Robertson*|2.482|
|25.|Charles Barkley*|2.437|




Gets slightly more muddied as you expand the list but it's still pretty much the top 25 players ever, just in a weird order. Obvious exception being Mel Daniels, who was an ABA legend but only played 1 season in the NBA.

937,The 0.5 LeBron James Club – a list of players with half or more of LeBron’s totals in each of the five major stats,nba,"On a separate post, /u/bobbletank posed a question that sparked my curiosity – how many players throughout the history in the NBA who amassed at least half of LeBron's totals in each of the primary 5 counting stats. I gave an answer there for the active players (or, more accurately, player singular, as it's literally just Harden), but it made me a bit curious to see what retired players would be included if we extended that to include all players in the history of the NBA.

The methodology is pretty straightforward – in order to make the list, a player had to have more than half LeBron’s totals in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks, (rounding down just for the sake of generosity). Going down the line, those thresholds are 19326 points, 5210 assists, 5333 rebounds, 1093 steals, and 536 blocks. Any player who didn’t meet or exceed each number naturally gets left off the list. 

One last statistical note is that not all stats were tracked throughout the history of the NBA. Blocks and steals, for instance, didn’t start getting tracked until the 1973-1974 season. As such, players whose careers largely or entirely predated that season (like Wilt) may be unfairly left off. However, even if I’m sure at least a few of them would make the cut had those stats been tracked, it would be unfair to just add them in without concrete numbers.

Now that caveat’s out of the way, let’s get into the list without further ado, shown in table form (including LeBron and the nonexistent entity I’ll be calling Half LeBron who serves as our benchmark):


Player|Points|Assists|Rebounds|Blocks|Steals|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
LeBron James|38652|10420|10667|1073|2186|
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|38387|5660|17440|3189|1160|
Karl Malone|36928|5248|14968|1145|2085|
Kobe Bryant|33643|6306|7047|640|1944|
Michael Jordan|32292|5633|6672|893|2514|
Kevin Garnett|26071|5445|14662|2037|1859|
James Harden|24693|7015|5648|543|1520|
Clyde Drexler|22195|6125|6677|719|2207|
Larry Bird|21791|5695|8974|755|1556|
Half LeBron James|19326|5210|5333|536|1093|

(Above data sourced from Basketball Reference, for full disclosure)

So as you can see, it’s a pretty exclusive club, with only Kareem, Karl Malone, Kobe, Michael Jordan, KG, James Harden, ""Clyde The Glide” Drexler, and Bird making the cut. Speaking for myself, there’s a few names I didn’t entirely expect here (Clyde and Karl Malone), and there’s a few names I thought would be here who aren’t (Magic Johnson being chief among them). I imagine Karl Malone will fall off the list this coming season, but everyone else is likely safe until the season after (Larry Bird starts to be at risk of falling off for assists should LeBron continue to play through that year, though).

Don’t really have anything else to say here. Just thought it was an interesting quick-ish research project once the question was posed, and figured I’d share the results here in case anyone else wanted to see the list as well. Feel free to let me know if you think I've missed someone - I'm pretty confident I didn't, but I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

I was on crutches and didn't realize I probably could've gotten some seating accomadation if I asked, so instead I hung out with my buddies STANDING the entire game behind the last row of the 300 section.

Though I was across the arena when it happened, I vividly remember Rodman laying out in an attempt to save a rebound, rainbow hair, stretched as far as he could go.

It later became a famous picture that many may recognize: https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/8/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/3/dennis-rodman-diving-for-loose-ball-sam-forencich.jpg

Since then I've been to a lot of games, and been fortunate enough to sit courtside, under the basket, and in far better seats.

972,Which team has the worst name in the NBA?,nba,"It's obviously the Jazz, I mean Utah doesn't even allow music.  This question gets asked over and over again during the offseason.  However, do you know why the Jazz are in Utah and not New Orleans?  

It's because the league really, really wanted the Lakers to be good and its actions completely destroyed the young New Orleans Jazz franchise forcing them to sell the team.

In 1976 after being a franchise for only two years, the struggling New Orleans Jazz were looking for a star to pair with Pistol Pete Maravich.  Free agent, and five time all-star, Gail Goodrich had just ended his contract with the Lakers and the Jazz offered him a great deal to play for them.  Gail signed a contract with the New Orleans Jazz on July 19th, 1976.

The league did not like the idea of ""Free Agency"" and forced the Jazz to give the Lakers assets in compensation.  The league demanded not one, not two, but three first rounds picks and one second round pick over the next three years.  The Jazz ended up ""trading"" these assets to the Lakers on August 5th, more than two weeks after the signing.

-


[In Gail's own words](https://www.deseret.com/1992/7/16/18994586/goodrich-tells-his-side-in-jazz-magic-deal), """"Going in, the Jazz did not know they were going to have to give up all those draft choices for me,"" said Goodrich. ""They made a deal with a free agent that they thought would help their team. But the league, in an effort to discourage free agency - I'm not sure they'll admit to this even now - stepped in and awarded the Lakers those draft choices as compensation.""


""It was a big settlement that New Orleans eventually had to agree to. But not until there had been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure from the league.""

""The truth is, there was no trade at all as far as myself and the Jazz were concerned. The Jazz signed me, and then the league demanded compensation to the Lakers.""

-

One of those three draft picks was a number one pick which turned out to be Magic Johnson.   He almost certainly would have turned the New Orleans Jazz into a winning franchise, if not a profitable one.

Unfortunately, after losing three draft picks in a row, and Gail getting injured, the New Orleans Jazz were terrible and broke. They ended up selling the team to Utah which for some inexplicable reason kept the name.

Even though the league propped up the Lakers yet again, I think this worked out best for everyone.  The Lakers got a Legend and several championships, Utah got a sports team and gave fans (including myself) a life-long love for the game, and New Orleans is New Orleans.  They already have an amazing city and don't really need more.  Seriously, New Orleans is amazing, go check them out.  Great food, music, and culture.",t5_2qo4s
973,Who’s better right now? Trae Young or Ja Morant,nba,"I think both these guys have become underrated, especially Trae, they’re my 4th and 5th best point guards, so I have them both over SGA, Fox and Murray(I do think SGA could pass them both next year depending on how things go)

I got Trae, I am biased but I just think other than Steph, Luka, and Dame no other PG has done what Trae has done these past 4 years. His WORST season is 26 and 10 on 43/33/90 and a good showing vs Boston in the first round. 
So offensively despite Ja being a better finisher, I don’t think it’s too close. 

However, I do think Ja has the the tools to be a good defender. He just hasn’t used them consistently at all yet, but if he does, and stays healthy, he could really be a special two way player potentially. 

Ja has the higher ceiling but to me Trae has been the better player thus far, also having more playoff success.

In 2018, the height drop coincided with some other sharper statistical shifts in league trends. There was of course a slight bump in size in 2022, we're still noticeably below where the league was and off the trend.

995,What percentage of fans actually watch 82 games a year?,nba,"I generally watch around 75 regular season games (I’m bound to miss a few), and then almost all playoff games.  I personally don’t know anyone else who does this and it’s kind of a bummer because all my guys friends are obsessed with football (I watch a ton of college and some NFL also).  

Does anyone else have this issue that none of their close friends really care about basketball as much as they do?",t5_2qo4s
996,"Who is better ALL-TIME and at their peaks?: Russell Westbrook, Gary Payton, or Walt Fraizer?",nba,"Russell Westbrook = MVP, Triple double leader (multiple times), scoring champ, assists champ, 1x finals appearance. Unfortunately, wasn’t able to capitalize in the playoffs multiple times.

Walt Fraizer = Multiple all-nba defensive first teams, 2x champion, 7x all star, was phenomenal in Knicks playoffs runs.

Gary Payton = DPOY, 9x all star, steals leader, multiple finals appearances, took the goat to six games, 1x champ (as a role player), easily the best defensively out of the 3.

Thoughts?",t5_2qo4s

998,What are the greatest (or worst) offseason posts in r/NBA's history?,nba,My personal favorite is one where someone asked if a player can kiss another player as a way to get into their head.,t5_2qo4s
999,Who was the most important player on the 2014 Spurs?,nba,"I haven't been an NBA fan for too long, and whenever I hear about this team it's usually about how they played really good team basketball. Looking *purely at the regular season and playoff* [*statistics*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAS/2014.html)*,* it seems as if it's a three-way tie between Tim, Tony, and Kawhi. However, I know statistics don't tell the whole story, and Tim and Kawhi were probably much better defensive players than Tony. It was clearly more of Tim and Tony's team in 2013 before Kawhi really took over in 2015. 2014 seems more like that transition year.",t5_2qo4s
