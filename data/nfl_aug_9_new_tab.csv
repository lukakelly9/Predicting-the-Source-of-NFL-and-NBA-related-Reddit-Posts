3,Erik Burkhardt shares some incredible revelations of former Browns QB Johnny Manziel in The Untold Story of Johnny Football. Here are a few that pertained to the NFL.,nfl,"Just watched the new special, there is a lot revealed about Johnny's college days but a surprising amount about his brief time in the NFL.

First is that Manziel was being drug tested by Burkhardt every week leading up to the NFL Combine. The night before the Combine, Manziel went to a party in the hills. **His Dad faked a heart attack so he could leave the Combine early**.

Second, the Houston Texans were going to take Manziel over Clowney, but video surfaced of him partying not long after his private workout with the team and they took him off their draft board.

Third, Manziel had dinner with the Browns and then partied at a hotel room with his receivers who were going to catch for him the night before a private workout and the receivers were so hungover a hungover himself Manziel **threw to his agent and his lawyer**. He told a reporter who covered the Aggies that he ""fucking killed it"" in the workout. Really.

Finally the second most amazing thing to me behind the fact that **Johnny's family wasn't actually loaded** (I know, right?!?!), Manziel's agent Burkhardt basically begged Jimmy Haslam to **come back in to the first and take Johnny**. Burhardt said his career was on the line. My immediate thoughts on this were holy shit it is cray how fluid the draft is, and now Haslam saying a ""homeless"" guy told him to draft Manziel makes *a lot* more sense.

Pretty crazy stuff and I know a lot of people won't watch here because they don't watch college football so thought I'd share.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15ms2ik,1.0,False,1691616356.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Cleveland Browns**

It will perch on the eagle’s back and peck at its neck. So rather than fight back and tear a crow to pieces, like it can. An eagle spreads its wings and soars as high as it possibly can. It keeps going, and going, and going, as high as it can. The higher the eagle flies, the harder it is for the crow to breathe. Eventually, the crow suffocates, falls back down to earth and dies. That’s what happens.""

Special teams are usually listed separately. K, P, and LS are unique roles. Most charts also list PR and KR- rarely a unique spot, and more often a RB/WR/DB who performs the role. 

I could see ST joining PR and KR as a separate listing. Christian Slater would be the most recent and clear-cut example. Always listed as WR, but only played that role for a few plays over his entire career..

Some teams may not have a player who fits the definition, but it would be akin to FB. List it if you have one.

106,[Effort Post] The NFL Top 100 is broken! A proposal for how to fix it!,nfl,"*Context: I am a statistician (with some experience in poll design), and I get needlessly annoyed about the NFL Top 100. As the list concluded today, here a (rather small) rant as well as possible solution.*

The issues around the voting for the NFL top 100 are well established. Even some former players like Pat McAfee [have spoken out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV2vfxZLgwc) about the fact that the voting procedure is not very well done. As a result the list heavily favours skill positions (QBs and WR alone make up 30 out of 100 players this year while there are only 8 linemen) and tends to feature established players past their prime over their younger counterparts. Even the NFLs own media team is [pointing some of this out](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-s-top-100-players-of-2023-five-things-the-voters-got-wrong).

For some context, [this](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/inside-the-top-100-voting-process) article by NBC sports explains the voting process: *""To vote, each player lists only his top 20 players in the league. The player listed at No. 1 gets 20 points, the player listed at No. 2 gets 19 points, and the process continues until the player listed at No. 20 gets one point.""*

The main issue with the current voting system is that it encourages tactical voting. Players vote for players on their team/position in an effort to boost their standing. This is very understandable: **If all players were to truthfully list their 20 best players, it would be unlikely that enough players even received votes to make a top 100 list.** To add to this issue only \~28% of the players actually vote (see nbc article above), so a players standing is likely highly impacted by how many of his teammates/players at his position voted. 

In my opinion, **a fairly easy way to fix this would be**:

* Each player gets 15 votes made up of:
   * 5 for players at his position (or position group?)
   * 5 for players on his team 
   * 5 players without any restrictions 
* Within each category, the first player gets 5 points, the second 4, etc. 
* Players can put the same player multiple times. e.g. A backup QB on the chiefs could put Patrick Mahomes as the No. 1 for all 3 categories

The score of each player would then be calculated as a **percentage of the total points that he could have gotten**. E.g. A cornerback on the Rams score would be: 

**\[total points\] / \[players that voted + players on the rams that voted + cornerbacks that voted\] / 5**

This new system would address a couple of issues:

* Players are less incentivised to vote for their teammates and position mates, as they have dedicated sections to do so
* Players get an outsized vote on players that they can actually evaluate (those that play their position, and those that they see at training)
* The list is no longer dependent on how many of a players teammates/position voted, as the score is calculated relative to that

In my opinion this process would result in a more fair but also more interesting list as it would likely feature players that few people outside the league have heard of. Then it would finally actually deserve its moniker: **""...as voted on by their peers.""**

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes.

117,2023 Offseason Review Series: Green Bay Packers,nfl,"# Coaching Changes

This offseason, the Packers allowed defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, whom Rasul Douglas credits with his turnaround from a practice squad castoff into a legit player, to walk to Atlanta, while they promoted safeties coach Ryan Downard to DB coach, and hiring Greg Williams from Arizona as their defensive passing game coordinator (no relation to Bountygate architect Gregg Williams). Rich Bisaccia was named assistant head coach in addition to his role as special teams coordinator, while outside linebackers coach Jason Rebrovich was promoted to pass rush specialist. They also hired some additional names (Tim Lester, senior analyst, Rob Grosso, offensive quality control, Kyle Wilber, special teams quality control).

## Projected 53-man, Training camp battles, Strengths and weaknesses

* QB (2): Jordan Love, Sean Clifford

*Training camp battles to watch:* It’s a fight between rookie Sean Clifford and USFL MVP Alex McGough, and Brian Gutekunst loves his draft picks. Last year, all eleven of his draft selections in April made his final 53 man roster, and expect Clifford to have a massive advantage coming in because of this, even if he were bad. Clifford has been good at camp though, and those who are watching have said he displays more zip on his throws than he did in college. Could it have been a coaching issue?

*Strength/Weakness?:* The lack of a vet backup is concerning, and it's fair to say that the Packers QB room is at least a huge question mark, if not a weakness. But in terms of matching the numbers of last year's performance, Jordan Love's job of being better than 2022 Aaron Rodgers (with a broken thumb) is not too difficult: Rodgers failed to hit 300 yards passing in any game last year.

* RB (3): Aaron Jones, AJ Dillon, Tyler Goodson

*Training camp battles to watch:* It will be interesting to see if any in a group that includes last year’s UDFA Tyler Goodson, returning vet Patrick Taylor, and seventh-round rookie Lew Nichols will be the third RB on the depth chart, if they make it at all. Brian Gutekunst kept just two on the initial 53 man roster last year. Nichols has missed some time with injuries during camp.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Fair to say Packers have one of, if not the, best running back tandem in football. Aaron Jones has been a dynamic playmaker every year he's been in Matt LaFleur's offense, and he's been pretty blessed with good health in that time. AJ Dillon is a thumping downhill runner, and he consistently gets a yard or two more than most backs would thanks to his size and strength. Expect Green Bay to lean into the run game, and lean into it a lot, to help out their young QB.

* WR (6): Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Samori Toure, Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks, Malik Heath

*Training camp battles to watch:* Packers coaches are raving about second-year pro Samori Toure, and it will be a question whether he or rookie Jayden Reed will get more snaps as the third receiver. On the other hand, it looks to be an uphill battle for rookie Grant DuBose to make the roster as he missed minicamp with injuries, all while undrafted free agent Malik Heath has impressed as he has run some reps with the first-team offense, something not even Wicks has managed to do.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Packers have the cheapest, youngest WR room in the NFL, with Christian Watson being the most seasoned vet here. Him and Doubs will need to make second-year leaps for this room to be considered a strength by any stretch of the imagination. 

* TE (4): Luke Musgrave, Josiah Deguara, Tucker Kraft, Tyler Davis

*Training camp battles to watch:* Will rookie Luke Musgrave immediately catapult to the top of the depth chart? Coaches and teammates have heaped praise onto just how fast and smooth he looks on the field. Or will third-year tight end Josiah Deguara, the most experienced pass catcher on the roster, start the season as TE1?

*Strength/Weakness?:* Just like the WR room, the TEs here are among the youngest in the NFL. TEs are also usually much more difficult to onboard than WRs, so look to some growing pains here as the rookies get their welcome to the NFL moments throughout the season.

* OL (9): David Bakhtiari, Yosh Nijman, Zach Tom, Caleb Jones, Jon Runyan Jr., Josh Myers, Elgton Jenkins, Royce Newman

*Training camp battles to watch:* Assuming Bakhtiari is healthy, it will be a fight between fifth-year former UDFA Yosh Nijman and second-year tackle Zach Tom to be the starter at right tackle. And if Nijman wins that fight, prepare to see the talented Tom, who played at every spot but center in his rookie year, to give third-year center Josh Myers a serious run for his money there. Bakhtiari, Jenkins and fourth-year guard Runyan all likely have their starting spots locked up, but there’s going to be a serious squeeze to be a backup interior lineman among third-year guard Royce Newman, second-year lineman Sean Rhyan, and fourth-year guard Jake Hanson, of which only two, maybe possibly just one, will make the roster.

*Strength/Weakness?:* When healthy, the left side of the line (with David Bakhtiari and Elgton Jenkins) is the best in football, and there's no question about it. And despite the struggles of center Josh Myers (in run blocking, primarily), expect the Packers offensive line to still be a strength overall, as they should give Jordan Love a comfortable time in the pocket if they can stay healthy. 

* EDGE (5): Rashan Gary, Preston Smith, Lukas Van Ness, Kingsley Enagbare, Brenton Cox Jr.

*Training camp battles to watch:* It's not a battle with a player, but Rashan Gary's timeline for his return from a season-ending ACL tear will determine the success of the Packers defense early on. He was activated from the PUP list yesterday. Preston Smith is likely solidified in his role as the number two pass rusher behind Gary, though behind him, it'll be a battle between second-year OLB Kingsley Enagbare and the rookie Lukas Van Ness. And behind them yet again, it will be down to Justin Hollins, a midseason pickup last year from the Rams, and Brenton Cox, a former Gator who went undrafted due to character concerns in spite of his pretty good tape. 

*Strength/Weakness?:* If Gary is back and healthy, which he seems to be given that he was activated from PUP, this could be a strength. Lukas Van Ness has flashed at camp and will get significant snaps spelling starters if he doesn't start. Preston Smith is a solid, dependable producer who will consistently get 5-8 sacks a year. But without Gary and Van Ness, this was a struggling unit last year, so mark this as a we'll see.

* IDL (5): Kenny Clark, TJ Slaton, Devonte Wyatt, Colby Wooden, Karl Brooks

*Training camp battles to watch:* The one here to watch will be whether TJ Slaton, the third-year man out of Florida, or last year’s first-round selection Devonte Wyatt, will serve as Kenny Clark’s primary running mate when rushing four. Slaton is a terrific run defender, while Wyatt has flashed as a pass rusher, so the expectation now is for them to get on the field when it suits their skillsets, but could either pull ahead to be the primary starter? Wyatt has been tearing up camp. The other battle to watch is if last year's seventh round pick, Jonathan Ford, makes the 53 man roster. LaFleur said he's had a great camp, but we haven't heard much.

*Strength/Weakness?:* If Devonte Wyatt is as good as advertised in camp, mark this as a strength. The Packers let a significant number of snaps walk out the door with Lowry and Reed departing, but their presence was a major factor in Wyatt not getting enough playing time last year. Kenny Clark is a fringe Pro Bowl talent every year who's the heart and soul of the Packers' run defense, and the rookies could have an opportunity to showcase their talents in obvious passing situations given their lighter weights and pass rushing acumen.

* LB (5): De’Vondre Campbell, Quay Walker, Isaiah McDuffie, Eric Wilson, Tariq Carpenter 

*Training camp battles to watch:* There's actually not a lot going on here. It's pretty clear what the pecking order will be, and the biggest off-season question at linebacker: whether Krys Barnes would return, was answered when the Packers didn't pick up his option. It’s clear the pecking order will go from Campbell, the one-time First Team All Pro, to Walker, who flashed in his rookie campaign, to McDuffie, who had a noticeable second-year jump in 2022, to Wilson, a special teams player for Bisaccia. One unanswered question here would be whether the Packers keep 4 or 5 linebackers, with 2022 seventh-round pick Tariq Carpenter, who competed at safety and was a special teams standout, competing for the fifth spot. 

*Strength/Weakness?:* Depends on if Campbell can prove that he can get back to his 2021 All-Pro form. He was supposedly hampered by injury throughout 2022, which led to inconsistent play, so hopefully a full offseason to heal will help. Walker was brilliant in pass coverage last year for an LB, even if his block shedding and tackling depth (how far down the field he gets to the runner) left something to be desired. 

* CB (6): Jaire Alexander, Eric Stokes, Rasul Douglas, Keisean Nixon, Carrington Valentine, Corey Ballentine

*Training camp battles to watch:* Keisean Nixon, a first-team All-Pro at kick returner last season, has said he intends to do the same at cornerback. He will potentially start the season in the slot with Jaire Alexander and Rasul Douglas outside while third-year corner Eric Stokes recovers from a season-ending foot and ankle injury in 2022. Once Stokes returns, it’s a question as to which two between him, Alexander and Douglas will play on the perimeter, and whether the loser of that battle will be able to displace Nixon in the slot. Stokes was terrific as a rookie but suffered an awful sophomore slump that saw him lose the latter half of his season to an injury at Ford Field in Week 9. Third-year safety Innis Gaines has also gotten playing time in the slot at camp. In addition, rookie seventh-round pick Carrington Valentine has been terrific at camp and made a play almost everyday; it will be hard to keep him off the field. Is it fair to expect him to be the primary backup if any of the outside corners go down?

*Strength/Weakness?:* Strength, especially on the boundary. Jaire Alexander is one of the best corners in football, and Rasul Douglas is still a ballhawk and competitor on the outside who can use his size and length to knock away passes. In the slot, there's a major question mark, as Douglas struggled there last year, and physically speaking, the player most suited to playing there would be Jaire, but you don't pay him $21M to be a slot corner primarily. 

* S (4): Darnell Savage, Rudy Ford, Jonathan Owens, Dallin Leavitt

*Training camp battles to watch:* Of these, Savage and Leavitt likely have their jobs secure, with Savage playing on his fully guaranteed fifth-year option, and Leavitt being a special teams ace. Ford also plays on special teams as a gunner, but between him, Owens and Moore, they only have $200,000 guaranteed combined among themselves. Will Brian Gutekunst keep five safeties? Any of them could be cut and it wouldn’t be a surprise. And don’t count out rookie Anthony Johnson Jr., a projected mid-round selection the Packers scooped up in the seventh round.

*Strength/Weakness?:* Weakness. Savage was damn near a liability in 2022, with seemingly half the big plays this secondary gave up resulting in a finger being pointed at or by him. And the selection of running mates opposite him isn't exactly inspiring either. Look to this, or OT, being the first pick of the draft by the Packers in 2024.

* ST (3): LS Matt Orzech, K Anders Carlson, P Pat O’Donnell

*Training camp battles to watch:* The Packers are likely going to keep Carlson, the brother of Raiders kicker Daniel Carlson. Pat O’Donnell, who was fine last year, faces a small challenge from all-XFL punter Daniel Whelan, while rookie Hunter … will try,, but likely fail, to challenge Super Bowl-winning long snapper Orzech, who received a 3-year contract from Green Bay.

*Strength/weakness?*: Orzech gives the Packers a dependable long snapper for the first time in nearly a decade, and O'Donnell was fine in 2022. Rookie Anders Carlson has had a rough start to camp, with good kicking strength but not a lot of accuracy. He's bounced back the last few days. Other than Carlson, and combining with the return/kicking protection units, expect Rich Bisaccia's special teams transformation program to continue having a major impact on the upward trend of this group.

147,Highest rated player at each position from the NFL Top 100 list (versus last year),nfl,"With everyone debating which players should have been higher/lower than others, it's interesting to look at the top rated player at each position:

155,"Brett Veach on potentially trading Chris Jones: “I think the best resolution would be for him to end his career as a Chief and get that financial security…hopefully, we get this resolved, but we have no intentions of making a trade.”",nfl,"&gt;“He’s a great player, and he wants a big contract,” Veach said. “He deserves a big contract, and I don’t think there’s any surprises in that regard. But there’s just some hurdles we have to work through in regards to how we can keep this thing going for the short- and long-term. But we’ve never wavered on, ‘This is a guy that we want to exhaust all of our efforts to get done,’ because that’s how much we think of him.”

&gt;Jones is due to make $19.5 million in 2023, the final year of his current contract. His contract comes with a non-waivable daily fine of $50,000. He reportedly wants $30 million per year.

&gt;Veach pointed out that last year’s trade of Tyreek Hill came in part from the recognition that, eventually, the team would have to address Jones’s contract.

&gt;“[W]hen we did make that move with Tyreek, one of the determining factors was because there was an expected Chris Jones deal,” Veach said. “And so, to do Tyreek, there was a concern of, ‘Would we be able to do Chris?’ “And so that was a moment of time, and it was before the draft, that we hit the reset button. And we’re like, ‘You know, it’s really hard to trade a player the magnitude of Tyreek Hill.’ But we’re following that up with someone just as significant and on the defensive side.”

&gt;“You reach this point where you, I think, both parties want to just kind of take a deep breath and reset a little bit,” Veach said. “And then [the talks] become less frequent, but at the same time, I mean, the start of the season is [September 8]. So by nature, they’re gonna have to heat up again. And like I said, that’s why we’re still optimistic.”

&gt;“Sometimes these things take some time,” Veach said. “So we’ll just continue to press away and work through that and hopefully make some movement here. We went into this, and as we’re having these ongoing dialogues, our intent and desire has always been to get Chris Jones secured for the foreseeable future, and we’re gonna press on with that mindset.”",t5_2qmg3,t3_15l3fif,0.94,False,1691457629.0

178,Players playing in the perfect era?,nfl," Which current players possess skills that are perfectly suited for the present era? I was reflecting on some exceptional players from past eras and pondering how they would fare in today's game. Some players might have been equally if not more successful in the current era (e.g. Deion Sanders, Steve Young, and Lawrence Taylor). Others probably would have needed to adapt to a different style of play (e.g. Mike Singletary).

This line of thought led me to consider the current era. There are undoubtedly great players today who might have thrived even more in a different era, like Derrick Henry. However, I believe that many present-day players wouldn't have performed nearly as well had they played 20-30 years ago. Among those, I consider Fred Warner as the player best suited to the modern era (though an argument could be made for Lamar Jackson).

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

210,2023 Offseason Review Series: Tampa Bay Buccaneers,nfl,"This is my first year attempting this post, and I've got some big shoes to fill taking over for /u/thefencingcoach but shoutout to coach for the numerous years of excellent write ups! 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

**Division:** The Division most likely to send a losing record to the playoffs in 2023 - aka the NFC South

**2022 results:** 8-9, 1st in the NFCS, wildcard exit vs the Cowboys.

**Coaching Departures:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**New Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Byron Leftwich|Offensive Coordinator|N/A|
|Clyde Christensen|Quarterbacks Coach|North Carolina Tar Heels|
|Todd McNair|Running Backs Coach|N/A|
|Kevin Garver|Wide Receivers Coach|N/A|

The best news of the Bucs offseason was that Byron Leftwich was ~~loaded into the cannons on the pirate ship and fired into the sun~~ let go from the team. There was a post recently about who the worst offensive coordinator was and I was very disappointed how far I had to scroll to find Byron in there.

I will tell you all right now that without a shadow of a doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure stats back it up that the worst offensive coordinator on any team in the NFL last year was 100% Matt Patricia. But I mean come on, Patricia's not a real OC. So while Patricia was doing his worst OC impression driving the Patriots offense off a cliff in his rearview mirror was Byron Leftwich absolutely tanking Brady's final year. Byron Leftwich was the most stubborn offensive coordinator who scoffed at reporters when they tried to present him with analytics about how piss poor the offense was under him. The only time out offense looked semi-competent last season was when Brady was in total control of play calls on 2 minute drives.

I swear Leftwich drew up one gameplan for the whole year and then huffed glue in his office Monday thru Friday. I don't get how anyone could be so braindead and not see that they were personally driving their career into the dirt. THIS MAN WAS CONSIDERED A TOP HEAD COACH CANDIDATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. Byron leaving Jacksonville without a contract because they wouldn't fire Baalke was the only time Jags fans ever appreciated that Baalke was there.

The only coaching departure that hurt me was Clyde Christensen. I'm honestly surprised he was let go because the pedigree of QB's he's worked with is insane. I still don't get why we axed him.

**Coaching Hires:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Coach**|**Position**|**Old Team**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dave Canales|Offensive Coordinator|Seattle Seahawks|
|Thad Lewis|Quarterbacks Coach|Bucs - Internal Promotion|
|Jordan Somerville|Assistant Quarterbacks Coach|University of Oregon|
|Skip Peete|Running Backs Coach|Dallas Cowboys|
|Brad Idzik|Wide Receivers Coach|Seattle Seahawks|

Dave Canales was not my first OC choice. I desperately had hoped we would lure Todd Monken back after his success at Georgia. But I can safely say that Canales is the most exciting hire we made this offseason and while he's obviously unproven I cannot wait to see what he can do for this offense. He had a hand in developing Seattle Russ and rescuing Geno Smith's career. Can he rescue Baker's career now?

Canales assembled his own staff here and I don't know much about a lot of the guys to be honest and I won't pretend to. It's exciting to get some new blood in the building though.

Also Bills/Browns/Texans/Eagles/Ravens/9ers/Ram's legend Thad Lewis was on the Bucs coaching staff last year and I had no idea. He got promoted to QB coach after Clyde was axed. I have nothing really to add here beyond that, but yeah Thad Lewis is there.

**Players lost/cut**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Player**|**Position**|**New Team**|

Tom Brady on his own is a big loss, but good lord this list is a damn long one.

So Tom Brady re-retired. Has he played his final down in the NFL? Perhaps. I didn't believe his initial retirement, I wasn't buying Tom going out after setting passing records at his age, but this past season seems to have brought him back down to earth. I don't blame most of the past season on Tom, but between Leftwich, Tom's divorce, and the team overall playing poorly it felt like Tom was actually ready to be done this time

I would be lying if I said I believed there was absolutely zero chance he returns. I'd comfortably say I'm 95% confident he's fully retired though.

Onto the rest of the list though. The Bucs entered this offseason knowing we'd be fucking super cash strapped.  A lot of us hoped Tom would return because we could mess with his cap hit but his retirement meant we finally had to pay the piper and eat his massive cap hit of $35 million. That combined with all the cap fuckery we did from 2020-2022 to keep most of our team around meant we were going to have to lose some guys. That and a lot of these guys are getting older. Notice how many are still free agents? A lot of those guys are just waiting for an injury and hoping for a desperate team to sign them.

~~I'd love to see Will Gholston return though as he's been a Buc his whole career, but I'm not sure we can even afford him one another 1 year deal (value around $4 million most likely).~~ I wrote this before we re-signed him, he's back baby!

Before we made the *big splash signing* with Baker the front office was talking about how they felt comfortable with what they had in Kyle Trask.

That immediately set off my bullshit alarm because of course they would say that about the ONLY QB they had on the roster at that point. Nothing about the way they've positioned Trask during his tenure tells me the front office actually believes he is the guy long term.

Now I was actually hoping we'd sign Baker last offseason while the rumors where swirling about which team would sign everyone's favorite sexual assaulter of 25 or more women. I know we Bucs fans can't talk too much shit because we had Jarapist Winston here for years, but that was a very tumultuous time for the fanbase but I don't think I could I could have handled something like that again.

Anyhow back on topic, we were saved from hell when Brady unretired and we didn't have to worry about the QB position in 2022. 

Now me personally I like Baker. He's not an elite QB by any means and I don't even expect he'll be our starter in 2024, but I was not mad at the signing.

We also re-signed Jamel Dean to a pretty team friendly 4 year contract which surprised many Bucs fans. After giving Carlton Davis a deal last year a good chunk of change it was very unclear how things in our secondary would shake out with a number of guys due for deals. Dean is a playmaker and I'm stoked we have him around for at least a few more years.

Edit: We also signed long time Buc William Gholston to a 1 year deal which was awesome. Happy to have him back as he's still excellent in run stopping.

**2023 Draft Class**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Round**|**Pick**|**Player**|**Position**|**College**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|19|Calijah Kancey|DT|Pittsburgh|
|2|48|Cody Mauch|OT|NDSU|
|3|82|YaYa Diaby|DE|Louisville|
|5|153|SirVocea Dennis|LB|Pittsburgh|
|5|171|Payne Durham|TE|Purdue|
|6|181|Josh Hayes|CB|Kansas State|
|6|191|Trey Palmer|WR|Nebraska|
|6|196|Jose Ramirez|LB|Eastern Michigan|

Our draft class certainly brought in some interesting and awesome player names. YaYa Diaby is fantastic and I also can't wait to hear announcers butcher SirVocea. Overall I'm not sure this draft had any 'knocked it out of the ballpark this guy is an instant stud' picks, but Licht did a great job finding depth pieces with the potential to be full time starters/stars.

**Calijah Kancey**: I don't think a single Bucs fan had us pegged to draft Kancey.  Most were pining for a tackle to replace Donovan Smith or a CB/S to replace Sean Murphy Bunting or Mike Edwards. The immediate comparisons Kancey got to Aaron Donald and John Randle though made me excited about his potential, but those are some damn big shoes to fill. He's undersized but he's got great burst off the line and could be a stud. - **A-**

**Cody Mauch**: I joked with the other Bucs mods about Mauch before the draft saying he would be ours and about how he looked like Ryan Jensen's distant relative. So imagine my hype when we actually drafted him. I did not watch a single down of NDSU football, but I am stoked about Mauch. His personality is infectious and he immediately bonded with Ryan Jensen. I don't quite know why we felt the need to trade up a spot to get Mauch but either way it's a solid pick. - **totally biased A++ (pessimist in me would go B+)**

**YaYa Diaby:**  Best name of our draft. I've read in places that this pick was a bit of a reach as he was graded for a day 3 pick, but YaYa's a pretty talented pass rusher and we certainly need help in that area. Expectations aren't super high for him but reports from camp thus far have been very high on his talent. Could end up being one of the best picks in this draft. - **B**

**SirVocea Dennis:** SirVocea is likely going to spend a lot of time on special teams but he's got an awesome vet to learn from in Lavonte David. He is undersized like David, but plays fast and hard. He's a depth piece that can hopefully develop into something more. - **B-**

**Payne Durham**: Another pretty good name from this draft class with a lot of potential. Rookie TE's rarely have a huge impact in their first year but Durham posed a good redzone threat at Purdue and if he can do that here that would be phenomenal. - **B-**

**Josh Hayes**: Another guy likely to be a special teamer. Best thing about him is his tackling form, but he's small and might not be tall/fast enough to play corner as a starter. If he can't carve out a role on special team he might not make the final roster. - **C+**

**Trey Palmer:** I wish I could say I was excited about this pick but man Jason Licht absolutely loves to throw 5th and 6th rounders at guys he wants to develop as returners and it rarely nets anything worth writing home about. Kenny Bell hype still lives rent free in many Bucs fans heads. We do need a deep threat to replace Scottie Miller, so if Palmer can surprise us and use his speed to fill that gap that would be great but I don't have high expectations there. - **C-**

**Jose Ramirez**: Normally I wouldn't give a damn about the final guy we draft because Jason Licht often takes project guys that don't make any impact on the team, but we desperately need pass rush help and Ramirez could earn at least a practice squad spot just from our limited depth at pass rusher. but as I've mentioned a few times now he'll likely make his bread and butter on special teams to start. - **C**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week - Buffalo Bills

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* Signed RB Marlon Mack to a 1-year deal
* Cut LS Jack Coco

Not too much news here but things haven’t been great at camp and it is clear they need QB Kyler Murray back and to add some pieces on both the offense and the defense. The Marlon Mack signing though was kind of sneaky and a good value add at the position for a bargain. It will be interesting to see the identity this teams develops with HC Jonathan Gannon in his first year and likely being without QB Kyler Murray for a bit of the year at least.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* TE Dakota Allen worked out for the team
* CB Jeff Okudah received positive news from MRI after injury scare
* TE Kyle Pitts likes that QB Desmond Ridder has taken the team by the reins
* Waived QB/TE Feleipe Franks, DL Ikenna Enechukwu, and WR Chris Blair
* Placed OG Ethan Greenridge on IR
* C Nick Buchanan worked out for the team

Overall good news here when it comes to CB Jeff Okudah as he was someone they took on with high hopes of being able to improve. Still good things coming out of camp about QB Desmond Ridder but also not too much coverage of him by national media. According to local media and news the team is behind him and he has been improving each day.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Defense has been showing out and QBs have been struggling with lots of INTs
* WR Zay Flowers has been extremely impressive in camp thus far
* CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury thought to be not that serious
* Team is unsure of when RB JK Dobbins will return to practice

Sorry Ravens fans but it sounds like the offense has seen major struggles thus far. Hopefully that is just because OC Todd Monken is installing the offense and the QBs are getting used to it and working to get on the same page. Good news for the team is that CB Rock Ya-Sin’s injury is not serious and that WR Zay Flowers has looked impressive. My main concern is around how much he will get utilized. Previously the offense and Lamar have emphasized throwing to TEs. Would be fun to see the offense opened up a bit more and give Lamar and JK more running lanes.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* Fred Jackson visits training camp practice
* TE/WR/Special Weapon Dalton Kincaid continues to show out
* QB Josh Allen isn’t sure about whether he wants to be on the show Quarterback
* WR Gabe Davis has been impressive thus far
* EDGE Von Miller has a chance to play week 1

Same stories this week from Bills camp. It sounds like the offense and the defense each look incredible and that Davis, Diggs, and Kincaid are showing out in the passing game. The hype appears to be building here. To me it appears that as the offseason goes on it is feeling more like it will be Jets and Bills at the top of the division battling it out with the Dolphins and Patriots maybe falling off a bit. We shall see what actually ends up happening.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* QB Bryce Young has had his ups and downs
* WR Jonathan Mingo has been showing out thus far
* Waived DT John Penisini and LB Arron Mosby
* Signed LB Deion Jones
* Signed EDGE Justin Houston to a 1-year $7m deal

As expected QB Bryce Young is having up and down days which is very normal for any rookie QB. Exciting to hear that WR Jonathan Mingo has been performing well. Great move by the team to add some veteran depth to the DL with Justin Houston and to have him to rush the QB as well. This team will be fun to watch because in their division they could very easily end up being the worst team and or the best team.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore establishing great chemistry thus far
* Agree to terms with TE Marcedes Lewis on a 1-year $2m deal
* Signed DE Yannick Ngakoue to a 1-year $10.5m deal

Hype is high around this team and it has even gone as far as QB Justin Fields having the most money bet on him to win the MVP. The same things happened with QB Mitch Trubisky not too long ago… Adding Marcedes Lewis and Yannick Ngakoue are each great moves and as promised with Ngakoue the Bears came through in adding a pass rusher like had been said.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* RB Joe Mixon has been sued over March 2023 shooting on his property
* RB Joe Mixon says he is taking a pay cut as a sacrifice to win a Super Bowl
* Agreed to 4-year contract extension worth up to $37.25m with LB Logan Wilson

RB Joe Mixon made a smart move to bet on himself and take a paycut because he doesn’t really split carries as much as some other backs do in the NFL so he really can try and win a Super Bowl as well as boost his stock for his next contract. Also, the team locked up Logan Wilson with a 4-year extension. This is important because everyone thinks about the offense here but the defense came through at some key points last year and one of those being in the playoffs against the Bills.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* LB Chuck Wiley working out for the team
* WR Daylen Baldwin waived/injured with a small tender tear behind his knee
   * Will receive an injury settlement
* WR Cedric Tillman is a player to watch. He had 2 receptions for 35 yards in HOF game
* HC Kevin Stefanski pleased with young players performance
* RT Dawand Jones did not allow a single pressure in preseason opener
* QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson did well in first preseason game
* Signed CB Lorenzo Burns

They had their first game of the year! Overall I thought the team looked good and was impressed by rookie QB DTR out of UCLA and WR Cedric Tillman. Will be interesting to keep following them over the next couple weeks of the preseason. Another player that was impressive and that will make QB Deshaun Watson happy is RT Dawand Jones. He did not allow a pressure the entire night and shut things down on the right side.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* Micah Parsons has his sights set on being one of the greatest Hall of Famers
* WR CeeDee Lamb is learning a lot from “smartest DB” CB Stephon Gilmore
* Agreed to a 3-year $24m extension with S Malik Hooker
* G Zach Martin has now reached over $500k in fines
* CB Trevon Diggs trash-talks QB Dak Prescott in practice
* Tyron Smith feels comfortable now that he is back at LT
* RB Ronald Jones suspended for 2 games for substance abuse

Team took another step to strengthen their defense by signing S Malik Hooker. This has to be tough for G Zach Martin to watch as the money available continues to decrease throughout the offseason. This is going to be an interesting division because the Cowboys, Eagles, and Giants all feel like they are going to be real deals and the Cowboys have the benefit of the division not having a repeat winner in a long long time.

**Denver Broncos:**

* Signed DT Forrest Merrill
* QB Russell Wilson and the rest of the starters will play in preseason opener
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* Signed ILB Austin Ajiake
* ILB Jonas Griffith and will miss the season
* RB Javonte Williams expected to play at some point in the preseason
* Signed CB Fabian Moreau
* Signed WR Nick Williams
* WR Tim Patrick ruptured achilles and will be out for the year

I imagine the Broncos first preseason game will be one of the more viewed preseason games because HC Sean Payton already said that a lot of the starters will play including QB Russell Wilson. Overall this past week was a good one for them besides the obvious bad news of the team losing WR Tim Patrick for the season. Wishing him a speedy recovery!

**Detroit Lions:**

* QB Jared Goff has been impressive thus far with significant development
* TE Sam LaPorta already becoming one of Goff’s main targets
* Signed Tae Hayes and Avery Davis
* Sold out season tickets for the first time in 21 years
* Waived/Injured TE Shane Zylstra

There really is excitement around this Lions team like most of us haven’t really seen before. To me the example of this team should be an ad for the show Hard Knocks. I am a huge fan of football but don’t always watch Hard Knocks but that was a great way for me to get a look behind the curtain at the Lions and really become of a fan of them. It is kind of similar to what the Quarterback show did for me with Kirk Cousins as well. Anyways it appears that only good news has been coming out of camp here for the past few weeks and hearing that Jared Goff has shown significant development should scare the other teams in the NFC North.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* TE Luke Musgrave was fastest person in practice recently beating out all WRs
* Added LB Arron Mosby off waivers
* QB Jordan Love making throws in practice

Not too much news here but QB Jordan Love has looked pretty good overall. With that though there have been some vocal doubters coming out this past week. Looking forward to him performing well and proving those doubters wrong. It sounds like that should be easier though than expected with TE Luke Musgrave showing that he might be the fastest TE in the league by beating out fellow WR teammates running this past week. The only concern I have heard with him is that he needs to work on his hands. The Packers sneakily could have some really good underrated weapons this year in Watson, Dobbs, Musgrave, Jones, and Dillon.

**Houston Texans:**

* George Fant signed a 1-year $4m contract with $2m guaranteed
* QB CJ Stroud has been taking more and more of teams 1st team reps each day
* WR John Metchie III is feeling “110 percent”
* DE Chase Winovich passed physical
* C Scott Quessenberry out for season with torn ACL, MCL
* Agreed to terms with TE Nick Vannett
* Released DE Demone Harris who is retiring

Sounds like QB CJ Stroud has slowly but surely taken the reigns away from QB Davis Mills for the team starting position. Good to hear that one of his likely top weapons is feeling good and better than ever. This team showed some heart towards the end of last year so it will be interesting if that heart and hard work under new head coach DeMeco Ryans will translate. They almost even upset the Chiefs even!

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* Signed TEs Nick Eubanks and Michael Jacobson
* Placed Ethan Fernea on injured reserve
* Signed RB Kenyan Drake
* CB Chris Lammons has been suspended 3 games (tied to Kamara incident)
* Hoping recent issues with RB Jonathan Taylor subside
* QBs Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew have each looked really imipressive
* Signed WR Amari Rodgers
* Waived Johnny King
* RB Zach Moss broke his arm and will be out about 6 weeks

Great move by the team to add depth at the RB position with Kenyan Drake. A surprise this week came when Chris Lammons was suspended due to involvement in the Kamara incident. QB Anthony Richardson has looked pretty good overall but has showed the normal signs of being of a young QB with up and down days. Nice thing here is that QB Gardner Minshew has looked really good but shouldn’t be threatening in the long term to Richardson making him feel more comfortable and able to go at his own pace.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* QB Trevor Lawrence gained 6-7 pounds of muscle this offseason
* OL Tyler Shatley back at practice after experiencing irregular heartbeat
* WR Calvin Ridley suffered minor toe injury
   * He feels he is one of the best in the league

Not too much news from the Jaguars but good to see that Herbert added some muscle to his frame as that should help when he takes hits in making him more durable. WR Calvin Ridley’s toe injury does not appear to be a big deal and shouldn’t impact him too much if at all in the coming weeks.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* Have been plagued by inclement weather
* WR Rashee Rice is proving to be extremely explosive
* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress in practice
* Have interest in RB Josh Jacobs should he become available
* DE Charles Omenihu suspended 6 games
* DT Chris Jones is seeking a “big” extension

The news here continues to be the positives of the young WRs on offense and the negatives on the defensive side of the ball. This week it was about DE Charles Omenihu being suspended for 6 games and then some cryptic social media posts by DT Chris Jones. I have not heard anything but it does not appear that the team is close to getting a deal done with Jones. Now that I say that they will probably get it done this week but who knows.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* QB Jimmy Garoppolo has showed early struggles in training camp
* EDGE Chandler Jones is expecting to have a big season and is feeling “10x healthier”
* Worked out LB Jaylon Smith
* Signed TE Jacob Hollister
* Waived TE OJ Howard
* WR Davante Adams is not thrilled that RB Josh Jacobs is at camp

The Raiders appear to be poised for a bit of a tough season from the offseason news. Things are not getting off on the right foot at least. Jimmy G has struggled with INTs and Davante Adams clearly talks to the need of having elite RB Josh Jacobs back. Hopefully the defense can step up like it sounds like they will but might be a rough year in arguably the best division in football.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* WR Quentin Johnston continuing to show out in practice

Slow news week for the team. WR Quentin Johnston has been impressive still and is someone I am very excited to watch this season.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Since the team has a lot of new players, most guys will be playing preseason
* WR Tutu Atwell is being moved around a lot in the offense
* TE Tyler Higbee has looked good in practice
* RB Sony Michel retired 1 month after signing with the team
* WR Cooper Kupp injured hamstring and will be cautious in return from the injury
* Activated OL Warren McClendon Jr. off the PUP list

Not too much news here but the team has to be happy that the Kupp injury is minor and are right not to rush him back from it. It should also allow other guys to get more reps in with Stafford to help understand more about who the other core targets will be.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* WR Tyreek Hill looking forward to embarrassing CB Eli Apple everyday
* DT Marvin Wilson worked out for the team
* HC Mike McDaniel says that QB Tua Tagavailoa “has added pitches to his arsenal”
* Signed CB Mark Gilbert
* Waive punter Michael Turk
* Signed DT Da’Shawn Hand and released DT Anthony Montalvo

Little fun banter between Tyreek and Eli Apple. Will be fun to continue to watch these guys go at it in practice. HC Mike McDaniel sounds happy about Tua adding pitches to his arsenal but the main thing Tua needs to be able to do in my opinion if this team wants to go far is make the off-schedule plays when he is knocked out of his rhythm. That was the issue last year besides his injuries and will be the main thing that prevents a deep playoff run this year if he hasn’t changed it.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Have interest in RB Kareem Hunt
* DT James Lynch tore his ACL and will undergo season ending surgery
* Signed RB Abram Smith
* Cut OL Bobby Evans
* Signed OL Christian DiLauro
* Signed WR N’Keal Harry

It was overall a quiet week for the team but they did add WR N’Keal Harry who maybe still has a high ceiling but a very lower floor and has not played anywhere near his expected potential since entering the league. Looking forward to seeing this team as the season gets closer.

**New England Patriots:**

* DE Matthew Judon revised contract with the team to guarantee him $14m this year
* QB Mac Jones has looked good and emphasizes working hard and having fun
* CB Jack Jones got thrown out of rep after physical rep with WR Kendrick Bourne
* WR Kayshon Boutte has worked his way into the 1st team reps
* Cut WR Ed Lee
* WR Jaylen Hurd retired shortly after signing

Great job by the team to get a deal done with Matthew Judon to revise his current contract. This should be viewed as a big win for players because he was still signed for another year and had his previous contract amended basically. Overall things have looked good at camp and the team is kind of quietly lurking behind the media noise being thrown at the other 3 teams in the division.

**New Orleans Saints:**

* RB Eno Benjamin suffered a torn achilles and is out for the season
* RB Alvin Kamara has been suspended 3 games
* Reached an agreement on a 2-year $27.5m guaranteed contract extension with DE Cameron Jordan
* Coach Jon Gruden has been around as a consultant for the team and QB Derek Carr
* CB Marshon Lattimore has been incredible this offseason

Tought news for the Saints running back room this week but good that they still have RBs Jamaal Williams and Kendre Miller. Great to see the team get a deal done with DE Cam Jordan because he will now likely be a Saint for life and has been through a lot with the city of New Orleans. CB Marshon Lattimore is looking good and I feel like it makes sense to say the Saints are the favorites in the NFC South.

**New York Giants:**

* QB Daniel Jones has looked extremely impressive thus far in camp
   * Good job of spreading the ball around to lots of targets but Waller and Campbell are favorites thus far
* WR Jalin Hyatt has consistently had a big chunk play in most practices

There has only been extremely positive news from camp about QB Daniel Jones. It is scary because it sounds like HC Brian Daboll is in the middle of doing with Daniel Jones what he did with QB Josh Allen just a couple years ago. This is definitely a make or break year it feels like for Jones despite signing that big contract.

**New York Jets:**

* CB Sauce Gardner got his degree
* QB Zach Wilson has shown maturity throughout camp and displayed a bit of that in HOF game going through his progressions
* Mekhi Becton played fewer snaps than expected due to knee discomfort
* OC Nathaniel Hackett responded to HC Sean Payton

Played in the HOF game and scored the first TD of the season so that has to mean something. QB Zach Wilson looks more mature overall with this play but still needs work. This team is going to be an exciting team this year and will be interesting how they stack up against the Bills.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* TE Dallas Goedert has a goal of a 1000 yard season
* OL Josh Sills found not guilty on counts of rape and kidnapping
* LB Nakobe Dean has been impressive thus far and is still pursuing a mechanical engineering degree
* WR AJ Brown sees RB DeAndre Swift being a big contributor catching the ball
* QB Jalen Hurts continues to improve and is more like a coach on the field
* Signed LBs Myles Jack and Zach Cunningham

This team does not appear to be taking any steps backwards after an impressive year last year and appear to be ready to be even better. Great add here to get a couple more LBs to add some depth the other day. Overall it just seems like teams are going to be able to stop this team on offense and then are going to have a hard time scoring on the defense. They are in a tough division it appears early on so it will be fun to see how things shake out.

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* WR George Pickens continues to make amazing catches in camp
* TE Darnell Washington creating mismatch problems already
* Rookie CB Cory Trice will miss season with non-contact injury

The talk of camp out of Pittsburgh has been almost exclusively about WR George Pickens but TE Darnell Washington got his fair share of media attention as well this week for just being a monster of a man. He is going to create matchup problems because of how big he is and could really develop into something special!

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* All 3 QBs have looked good thus far for the team but no one has really separated themself
   * QB Brock Purdy still expected to the starter and progressing well
* Signed OLB Taco Charlton and he is showing out in camp thus far after being a late addition
* WR Brandon Aiyuk continues to be the most impressive player in camp
* Signed EDGE Daelin Hayes after putting DE Darryl Johnson on season ending IR
* DC Steve Wilks working a lot with the DBs
* RB Ty Davis Price has been incredible throughout camp
* Signed DB Anthony Averett and placed Terrance Mitchell on IR

Another week of everyone having an opinion about the QB room here. To me it feels like all of the QBs are playing really well. They all have over 60% completion percentage and haven’t thrown many INTs and have done well in the move the ball periods. It is clear though that the team plans to have QB Brock Purdy as QB1 going into the year as long as they feel he is fully ready to take the hits in his return from injury. Other than QB stuff two standouts other than WR Brandon Aiyuk have been RB Ty Davis Price and recently signed OLB Taco Charlton. This is great news because it adds depth at positions that are already some of the strongest on the team.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* WR D’Wayne Eskridge suspended 6 games
* QB Geno Smith texted HC Pete Carroll prior to the draft saying they needed to get WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba
* QB Geno Smith will not face DUI charges from Jan 2022 arrest
* Signed NT Robert Cooper and waived NT Roderick Perry
* Signed OT Liam Ryan
* CB Riq Woolen passes physical and activated

Not great to see another player in WR D’Wayne Eskridge get suspended but I think that it is clear that the message the NFL is trying to send regarding personal conduct, gambling and other issues. Other than that, cool to see the team invest in someone their QB wanted in WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba and at least the early returns we have seen. Hopefully they can put things together to have a good season.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* QB Baker Mayfield has struggled recently and QB competition is heating up
* OT Tristan Wirfs met with team psychologist about anxiety from switching from RT to LT

Good on OT Tristan Wirfs getting ahead of things and getting things taken care of so that he can be the best player he can. Sounds like the QB competition may be heating up here but not due to anyone looking really good but rather QB Baker Mayfield not looking as good as everyone hoped.

**Tennessee Titans:**

* Released OL Jamarco Jones
* WR Treylon Burks has impressed with his physicality thus far
* Agreed to terms with C Jimmy Murray
* Waived WR Jacob Copeland
* Arden Key will play critical role in defense
* QB Will Levis has shown good command of the offense

It sounds like the Titans are going to be a bit of a darkhorse this year. They should have two really good receivers this year and arguably the best bell cow running back in the league. Also, despite folks wanting to move on from Tannehill he is still a Jimmy G level quarterback meaning he can win with good supporting pieces around him that he has. With the Titans you know that defense is never going to be an issue so this could be an exciting year for fans here.

**Washington Commanders:**

* CB Emmanuel Forbes tweaked his groin
* WR Terry McLaurin has been impressed by QB Sam Howell’s deep ball
* A petition to change the team name back to the “Redskins” has reached over 50k signatures
* DT David Bada placed on IR with torn triceps
* EDGE Chase Young is feeling explosive

If EDGE Chase Young can return to form this team could have a completely different season than if he can’t. It is clear that when teams can get pressure to the QB it changes the game entirely. Great to hear that McLaurin and Howell are enjoying playing together but having a strong defense would make QB Sam Howell’s life so much easier as a young QB in the league.

**Miscellaneous/Other NFL News:**

**Restaurant of the Week:** Oneill's Stadium Inn

This week’s restaurant may be the closest one to the stadium in this series yet. Oneill’s is less than a half mile from Highmark Stadium and is a well known pre/postgame hangout spot because they open at 11am EST and close at 1am EST most days. Highly recommend starting things out here with the Loaded Potato Skins and then going right into the Beef on Weck or the Chicken Finger Sub! They will definitely leave you full and ready to go watch a game or head home for a snooze. If you do find a bit more space though it is worth it ask about their homemade shakes! I would recommend if you are not someone who can handle the cold that you make Buffalo and this place an early stop during the season rather than going late in the season after winter has started.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15kkerh,0.82,False,1691414030.0

218,"From 2014-2017, Andy Reid went 6-1 against Super Bowl participants",nfl,"**2014: Defeated Patriots 41-13**

Gotta give Reid credit. He massively outcoached Bill in this one. Alex Smith went 3 TD, 0 INT, 144.4 rating. Knile Davis and Jamaal Charles combined for 200 yards. And Kelce being Kelce.

**2014: Defeated Seahawks 24-20**

Again Reid outcoached a defensive wizard. Dude schemed Jamaal Charles to take apart the LOB having nearly 200 all purpose yards and 2 TD.

*2015: Lost to Broncos 24-31*

Coincidentally the last time Reid has lost to Denver. Still 24 points on that Denver defense was pretty impressive.

**2015: Defeated Broncos 29-13**

Poor Peyton. Reid's Chiefs intercepted him 4 times resulting in his benching. Offense did not turn the ball over against that crazy good defense of Denver.

**2016: Defeated Falcons 29-28**

SB54 wasn't the first time Reid outgunned Shanahan and he didn't have the QB or weapons that Shanahan had on this day.

**2017: Defeated Patriots 42-27**

Reid outcoaches Bill at Foxboro dropping 40+ again. Bill's defense had no answer for Kareem Hunt or Tyreek Hill on that day. Alex Smith with 4 TD and 0 INT.

**2017: Defeated Eagles 27-20**

Eagles had a top 5 defense that year but Kelce did what Kelce does reeling in 8 of 10 for 103 yards and a TD. Reid kind of owns the Eagles as a Chief.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15k6kt1,0.83,False,1691371477.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Buffalo Bills**

#I. FAQ

**What the hell has been going on with the injuries the past 2 seasons and why is this the biggest thing everyone forgets about the 2022 season?**

This is a question mostly asked by Titans fans and mostly ignored by everyone else. [In 2022 the Tennessee Titans had the most man-games missed with 339, ahead of 2nd place by 36 games.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1613666282292871170?s=20) This has now become a trend, as it is the [2nd year in a row that the Titans have been top 3 in this category](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNFL/status/1478875917564919810?s=20). The Titans have been absolutely brutalized by injuries the last two seasons. The Titans were able to [overcome this in 2021 and get the number 1 seed anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rvv4yf/updated_comprehensive_list_of_the_titans_injuries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), however in 2022 the injuries proved too much. 

It’s not controversial to say that the only reason the Titans didn’t win the division in 2022 is because of injuries, it’s just something people forget about. The Titans were 7-3 before letting injuries catch up to them and going on a 7-game losing streak. [Here is a direct comparison that I made of Titans and Jaguars injuries in the 2022 season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/15ajccp/comparing_the_titans_2022_injuries_to_the_jaguars/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The Jaguars were the least injured team in the league in 2022, and the quality of players that were injured for both teams was also a major disparity. As I said in my post, my hot take is that the Titans and Jaguars will almost certainly not have such a wide disparity in injuries this season, and that is something that should absolutely be considered when discussing a potential 2023 AFC South Champion. 

As for what it means? If we are to assume that the Titans players are taking care of their own bodies to the same level as every other player in the league, then a natural conclusion would be that injuries are almost entirely luck based. There have been calls to completely overturn the strength &amp; conditioning staff and the training staff, but I just don’t see the real benefit to that. The most the team can do is offload some of the worst offenders of repeated injuries (e.g. Bud Dupree, David Long, etc) and maybe alter the practice schedule to be more in line with whatever it is the healthier teams in the league are doing and see if that works, which the Titans are doing. One thing they are doing is replacing all ""jog-throughs"" with ""walk-throughs"". The idea is that during jog-throughs their players were running close to full speed when the idea is to give them a break.

**Is Ryan Tannehill on the “hot seat”?**

Not in 2023. Ryan Tannehill is, objectively (kind of), the most underrated quarterback in the league. Ryan Tannehill, since 2019, [has been in the top 10 of pretty much every QB efficiency rating](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1680929822996930561). Tannehill is an average to above average QB in this league by most metrics that aren't based on volume, yet he is consistently ranked in the bottom 10 QB's around guys who have not proven they can win in this league like Justin Fields and Jordan Love. [Here is a short video that goes deeper into the underrating of Ryan Tannehill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxex6IpsDo)

There has been no indication from the team that they have any interest in playing a QB other than Ryan Tannehill this season. It’s comical to Titans fans that so many people this offseason talk about the Titans as if Will Levis is the starting QB in 2023. Tannehill is in a contract year this year, so next year is certainly up in the air, but he could play himself into a new contract. But for now, he is firmly the Titans' starter this season. I do not see the Titans turning to Levis or Willis unless disaster occurs (like last season) or the Titans are eliminated from the playoffs early. Ideally, the Titans will redshirt Levis and Willis this season.

#II. Front Office/Coaching Changes

**Ran Carthon hired as Titans GM**

I like the hire, Ran came from the 49ers and I like their team-building philosophy overall (even if I don’t like some of their moves like trading a haul for a non-elite QB prospect). He brings something the Titans infamously avoided under the Jon Robinson era: Analytics. If you want to know more about Carthon, [here is the announcement article from the team.](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/news/titans-hire-former-49ers-director-of-player-personnel-ran-carthon-as-the-team-s-#:~:text=NASHVILLE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Titans%20have%20officially,pro%20personnel%20in%20San%20Francisco.) 

**Monti Ossenfort Hired as Cardinals GM**

Frankly, the short time that Monti Ossenfort has been in Arizona has manifested evidence that he may have been the true issue in the Jrob era: he watched Dennis Daley and Geoff Swaim both attempt to play football from his box in Nissan stadium and decided to sign them to his new team on contracts that were MORE THAN VET MINIMUM (nobody was forcing this man to do this). Truly baffling how this man got a GM job if those are the moves he’s making. Maybe he’s really tanking? I hope so. Sorry Cardinals fans.

**Tim Kelly elevated to OC:** 

This is easily one of the most significant coaching changes ever under Vrabel, as it’s the first time Vrabel has ever fired a coordinator. Todd Downing held this role previously for 2 seasons and, to put it nicely, was an underwhelming OC. For example, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGCbuMmc93g) is how Todd Downings' basic and elementary passing concepts cost the Titans a playoff game in 2021. He has since been hired as the Jets “Passing Game Coordinator”. (if you’re a Jets fan or if you hate the Jets that video I linked is required viewing.) The biggest and most legitimate criticism of Mike Vrabel is that his loyalty to coaches hurts him. Not firing Todd Downing last offseason proved to be a massive mistake.

Tim Kelly was brought on to be the Passing Game Coordinator in the 2022 offseason. When asked about his role in 2022 Mike Vrabel said that he [“asked him to focus and assist with TEs at practice and a lot of preparation during the week, working with former OC Todd Downing and Vrabel himself. Worked a lot on the 1st and 2nd down passing game.”](https://twitter.com/eastonfreeze/status/1623090153861394433?s=20). Okay sounds great right? It does until you realize that Todd Downing is still calling the plays and the Titans ran the ball on first and second down at a very high percentage relative to the rest of the league. For what it’s worth though, [the Titans were above average in efficiency on 1st and 2nd down passing in 2022 while being a bottom 8 passing team on 3rd and 4th down.](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1623131643111256064?s=20) That’s not all Kelly did though, as he also had a major part in red zone offense. Naturally the Titans, who had one of the lowest-scoring offenses in the league, were probably bad in the red zone right? Actually no, the Titans had [one of the most efficient red zone offenses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/xwa5ay/top_red_zone_offenses_by_dvoa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the most efficient goal line offense in the league in 2022.](https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1685309336447287296?s=20) The problem with the Titans offense was the 80 yards it took to get to the redzone. 

So, what else does Tim Kelly bring to the table as an OC? Well, he spent 2 years under Bill O’Brien at Penn State as a graduate assistant before following him to the NFL. He had a hand in developing the former Texans sexual predator (he’s still a sexual predator, just not with the Texans anymore) as well as essentially having complete control over the offense that led to rookie QB Davis Mills having a much better-than-expected rookie season (side note, but Mills struggled mightily without Kelly last season). The former Houston predator has said that Tim Kelly had a ton to do with his development, and his endorsement was the reason that Kelly was retained on the Texans staff in 2021 despite turnover to most other positions. Given his track record, there is a lot of hope for the Titans offense under Tim Kelly. 

**Grade:** A+

**Chris Harris Hired as Defensive Pass Game Coordinator/Cornerbacks Coach:**

Chris Harris joins the Titans after spending three seasons as Washingtons' DB coach. Anthony Midget was previously the CB coach but was not retained. Chris Harris brings a lot of hype as a coach. When he was hired it was essentially with the caveat of “unless he gets hired as a DC elsewhere” as he had a ton of interest from other teams. He’s been given a major role on this staff to improve a statistically poor 2022 pass defense. 

**Grade: A+** 

**Charles London Hired as Pass Game Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach**

Charles London served the last two seasons as QB coach for Arthur Smith in Atlanta. Hopefully he can bring some of the Arthur Smith magic back to the Titans offense. 

**Grade: A**

**Jim Schwartz leaves to be the Browns DC after 2 seasons as a Senior Defensive Assistant with the Titans**

Something worth noting, as the value of Schwartz was hotly debated amongst Titans fans and never fully understood. His role in the defense was kept somewhat secret or downplayed for the most part, but mostly had to do with assistance with game planning. Shane Bowen remains the Titans DC for the 4th consecutive season. However, losing Schwartz’s experience in the room can only be seen as a negative for the team. 

**Grade: F** (but also probably not a big deal)

**Lori Locust becomes the first woman ever on the Titans coaching staff with the title of Defensive Quality Control:** 

Locust was previously an assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay and is generally considered to be a very good coach, with success at all of her stops so far. 

**Grade: A+** 

Other Coaching Changes:

* Justin Hamilton has been hired as Defensive Quality Control.
* Jason Houghtaling is now the team's new offensive line coach. He replaces Keith Carter, who was not retained and is now the offensive line coach for the Jets.
* Luke Steckel was moved from TE's coach to Run Game Specialist. Steckel then left the team to be an Assistant Offensive Line Coach for the Bears.
* Pat O'Hara is now the team's Pass Game Analyst. O'Hara previously served as quarterbacks coach.
* Tony Dews is now the team's Tight Ends coach. Dews served previously as Running Backs coach, and that position has been filled by Justin Outten who is also serving as the Run Game Coordinator.

|Andrew Adams|S|UFA|N/a
|Randy Bullock|K|UFA|N/a
|Jamarco Jones|OL|UFA|N/a


**Notable Losses:**

* **Nate Davis:** Davis is a consistently solid to good but never great guard. He is easily the biggest loss for the Titans this season, but the Titans thought they could Moneyball the O-Line. He's usually a really good run blocker, especially in a zone scheme, but inconsistent in pass protection. He also started to deal with some injuries and missed the end of the season. Happy for Davis on the big contract. 
* **Robert Woods:** I guess it’s just the WR market but Woods getting over $7 million is wild (a little more than half of what the Titans are paying Hopkins). While it could be expected that he’ll be better another year removed from the ACL injury, the man very clearly just did not have the juice in 2022. Very happy the Texans signed him to that contract, solidifying their receiving corp as one of the worst in the league and easily the worst Stroud has ever had. 
* **Demarcus Walker:** Walker came out of nowhere last season. While he only played 33% of the snaps last season for the Titans, he was a very effective player. This is certainly a loss for the Titans but one that was supplemented with other additions in free agency. 
* **David Long Jr.:** David Long Jr is a great ILB, unfortunately his biggest issue is staying on the field. The Titans decided to try to get healthier this offseason by essentially giving the contract Long got in Miami to Azeez Al-Shaair. If Long can stay healthy in Miami, that will be a massive pick-up for them.  
* **Bud Dupree:** Most people thought the Titans overpaid Dupree when they signed him to (at the time) the biggest contract the Titans had ever given to a pass rusher, and boy were they right. Dupree was an average OLB when he was on the field, never even good really. Unfortunately, average is not what the Titans paid him to be with that massive contract. On top of that, he only played 21 games in his 2 seasons with the Titans due to multiple injuries. The Titans will be feeling the effects of this contract for a while. 
* **Ben Jones/Taylor Lewan:** I’m not going to lie, both of these hurt my heart. Ben Jones was an awesome center and one of Mike Vrabels' favorite players ever. He was the perfect mix of toughness and smarts. Unfortunately, Jones suffered 2 concussions last season, and while he hasn’t announced retirement yet, many think it would probably be his best move. Last season, after coming off a mixed bag of a year in 2022 after tearing his ACL in 2021, Taylor Lewan was having a good season for 64 snaps until he tore his ACL again. Now he will very likely be retiring soon. Both of these guys were staples on the Titans' offensive line for so long, it’s sad to see them go.
* **Dennis Daley:** Daley is the definition of addition-by-subtraction. This man is the worst OL I’ve ever seen get consistent playtime. I have no doubt in my mind that the Titans will have a better offensive line in 2022 than 2023 simply due to the fact that Daley is gone. You might be thinking “Oh this dude is just on hopium, Dennis Daley for 16 games probably isn’t THAT bad.” No, he is that bad, in fact he was the worst tackle in 2022 and one of the worst ever by Sack Allowed %. At one point late in the season he had given up [the most sacks and the 2nd most pressures, despite being very low in pass-blocking snaps among tackles.]( https://twitter.com/TitansStats/status/1602333692046835716?s=20) He ended up tied with Jonah Williams for most sacks allowed with 12, but Jonah Williams played 205 more pass-blocking snaps. When they finally decided to replace Daley with 2nd-year bust Dillon Radunz, he unfortunately tore his ACL after a handful of plays which thrust Daley back into the starting lineup. After that, there were no more options. The fact that the Cardinals signed this man to anything more than veteran minimum is such a joke and makes me very happy that we got Monti Ossenfort out of our building if those are the moves he makes (unless he’s truly tanking, in which case bravo). 
* **Geoff Swaim:** Another addition-by-subtraction move, I have no idea what is going on in Arizona. Geoff Swaim can best be described as “a blocking TE that can’t block”.
* **Jamarco Jones:** The Titans signed Jamarco to a contract to be a backup OL in 2022. He subsequently tried to fight Taylor Lewan in practice before hurting his elbow and missing the whole season. For 2023, many thought he might be the Titans starting RT with NPF suspended for 6 games. But it turns out [Jones really  loves being an asshole fighting and taking cheap shots in camp and Vrabel wasn’t here for it so they cut his ass a few days ago.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38129434/titans-cut-rt-jamarco-jones-back-back-practice-ejections)

|Naquan Jones|DT|1-year RFA tender|$940k

* **Jeffery Simmons:** One of the biggest stories of the offseason was the Titans giving Jeffery Simmons a 4-year contract extension to make him (at the time) the highest-paid DT not named Donald. Big win for all parties involved, getting the deal done before the other major DT’s to save just a little bit of money was also a nice cherry on top.

|Chris Moore|WR|Houston Texans|1 Year|$1.3 Million
|Trevon Wesco|TE|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$1.2 Million
|Chris Hubbard|RT|Cleveland Browns|1 Year|???

* **DeAndre Hopkins:** [DeAndre Hopkins has dominated the Titans since joining the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/157pq3s/fun_painful_fact_deandre_hopkins_career_stats_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) So I’m just happy this man can’t hurt our defense anymore. My most common player comp for Treylon Burks coming out of Arkansas was DeAndre Hopkins, so I’m very happy he gets to learn from him now. [Here is a film breakdown on why this was a great signing for the Titans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3XdikNDng)
* **Andre Dillard, Daniel Bunskill, and Chris Hubbard:** The Titans are basically money-balling the offensive line this season, which is what you have to do when you essentially need to replace an entire offensive line in one offseason but also have very little cap space. Andre Dillard is a guy who, as a former first-round pick, has a lot of potential. He couldn’t carve out a consistent spot on the great Eagles offensive line and dealt with some injuries, so now he finds his home in Tennessee where they hope he can turn into a solid starting LT. His contract is interesting, if Dillard lives up to his potential it will be a steal of a contract. [Here is a film breakdown on Andre Dillard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R16wuRrY9Pk) Daniel Brunskill is a guy that you want to have as your backup 6th OL, but he is being slotted into the starting RG spot here. While Brunskill is a significantly worse run blocker than Nate Davis was, he actually is probably on par or even better than him as a pass protector. Chris Hubbard will likely fill in for NPF at RT during his 6-week gambling suspension. There is an unlikely world where Hubbard plays well enough to hold onto that job upon NPF’s return. 
* **Arden Key:** This is a very interesting signing to me. 2 years ago, the Titans signed Denico Autry who had most recently played for the Colts. When they did, Colts fans were upset they did not re-sign him because the Titans got him on a very affordable contract. Denico Autry felt disrespected by the Colts, and while he’s been a great player all around for the Titans (worth more than what the Titans are paying him), he seems to turn it on against the Colts especially. The Arden Key signing feels EXACTLY like the Denico Autry signing, just with the Jaguars. Much like Autry, [Key felt disrespected by what the Jaguars offered him.](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/arden-key-felt-disrespected-by-jaguars-in-free-agency). Key owned the Titans in 2022, the fact that the Titans don’t have to play against him in 2023 is honestly great news alone. Key has been tearing it up in camp so far and is getting a lot of hype. He brings a lot of energy as well. The Titans are very hopeful this turns out exactly like Denico Autry. [Here is a film breakdown of Arden Key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-vlUkNbIUw)
* **Azeez Al-Shaair:** Will be the Titans starting ILB. Solid player. Al-Shaair is a downgrade from David Long Jr in terms of on-field ability but an upgrade in general availability. 
* **Sean Murphy-Bunting:** SMB will be a starter in the Titans' secondary. He has a lot of experience playing both on the inside and the outside, but for the Titans he's expected to be an outside corner mostly. [Here is a film breakdown on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIL9DK7z14)
* **Chris Moore:** I’m only highlighting this one to continue to point out how absurd the contract was the Texans gave to Robert Woods. Look at their 2022 stats: [Chris Moore]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorCh00.htm), [Robert Woods]( https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo02.htm). Like they’re roughly the same player but Moore (who is slightly younger and hasn’t had a recent ACL tear btw) is making 18% of what Woods is making! Anyway, Moore is primed to be the Titans' 4th or 5th receiver this season, Vrabel has been in love with him so far during camp stating that he wishes he was on the team “the last few years”.

**Significant Picks:**

* **Peter Skoronski:** Skoronski was both the BPA for the Titans and fills a significant need for the team. While he played LT in college, most scouts projected him as a guard in the NFL (mostly due to his short arms). He will start out as the Titans' LG, and most expect him to be solid there for his rookie season. My favorite Skoronski stat is that he allowed just 6 pressures in 474 pass-blocking snaps at LT at Northwestern in 2022. 
* **Will Levis:** This is a very polarizing pick. Some people love the value, some people hate it. The Titans gave one 2nd and a 2024 3rd and moved down in the 3rd this year to draft Levis. It leaves the Titans with just 4 picks in next years draft, which for a team that will likely be rebuilding is obviously not good. It is ideal that Levis has an opportunity to redshirt for a year and learn from Tannehill, who was his most common player comp coming out of college. One thing most people don’t realize about Levis (I certainly didn't until the Titans drafted him) is that he was playing with a hurt foot in 2022, which was likely the biggest reason for his regression (that and losing his OC). It's reasonable to expect that he is much closer to the prospect he was in 2021 than 2022. [Levis 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeFMkUk4W0)
* **Tyjae Spears:** Tyjae is expected to be the Titans' number 2 RB this season. His final season at Tulane was elite, [averaging at least 4.5 yards after contact in each of the past two seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2023-nfl-draft-grades-all-day-2-picks). The biggest concern for Spears is injury potential; while he was projected by most to go higher than pick 83 the injury potential had him drop lower. Fun fact about Spears: he does not have an ACL in one of his knees. While I like the player, I’m not sure that running back was the best use of a 3rd round pick for this team. Another offensive lineman or DB would have been ideal here for me. [Spears 2022 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgnCIclV9U)

**Overall Draft:** Overall I thought this draft was just okay, but I love the Skoronski pick. I like the potential of our day 3 picks as well. Outside of maybe Spears, I don’t love how little overall impact I expect from every other pick in 2023. 

Grade: **B-**

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:Pittsburgh Steelers**

The NFL is preventing **ALL 3 of the top RB** from entering the market at fair market value. They have clearly suppressed the RB market through their mutual actions.  Each of the 3 franchising teams economically benefited from the other 2 teams. 

I'm not a lawyer and proving collusion in court is difficult, but this does hit the check boxes of conclusion.   


Note: This scenario is never the intent of the CBA. A single position per year is supposed to be the norm. The CBA should have a limit of 1 position per year or some other preventative measure.

**Record**: 14-3, 1st in NFC East, Lost to KC in Super Bowl LVII. [32 Teams/32 Days recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/11svvbz/2023_32_teams32_days_philadelphia_eagles/?user_id=19180238&amp;web_redirect=true)

Coaching changes:

|Position|In|From|Out|To|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Offensive Coordinator|Brian Johnson|Eagles QB Coach|Shane Steichen|Colts HC|
|Defensive Coordinator|Sean Desai|Seahawks asst. HC/def. asst.|Jonathan Gannon|Cardinals HC|
|QB Coach|Alex Tanney|Eagles asst. QB coach|Brian Johnson|Eagles OC|
|LB Coach|D.J. Eliot|Temple DC/OLB coach|Nick Rallis|Cardinals DC|
|DB Coach|D.K. McDonald|Eagles asst. DB coach|Dennard Wilson|Ravens DB coach|

The Eagles were expected to have plenty of assistants in high demand after their Super Bowl run, and they ultimately lost OC Shane Steichen and DC Jonathan Gannon to head coaching gigs. (Although not many Eagles fans view the latter as a loss.) In response, Nick Sirianni made a concerted effort to maintain the continuity of 2022’s staff while bringing in plenty of outside names to lend experience and keep things fresh. An example of this continuity is the promotion of QB coach **Brian Johnson** to OC - Johnson has years of OC experience at the college level, and he and Hurts have a long history. An example of this commitment to new faces is the addition of **Sean Desai** as DC - while Vic Fangio was the dream, Desai is younger and should offer the flexibility and varied background that should cater to a new-look Eagles defense.

The Eagles also added multiple coaches that each carry with them decades of coaching experience, both at the pro and college levels. The most prominent name of these is senior defensive assistant **Matt Patricia**. Say what you will about his Lions tenure or his disastrous offensive playcalling in New England last year, but Patricia at least carries nearly 2 decades of NFL coaching experience, mostly as a defensive assistant under the best defensive head coach of this generation. Senior offensive assistant **Marcus Brady** also carries NFL playcalling experience with him; Brady was Sirianni’s replacement as Colts OC when Sirianni joined Philly. Defensive assistants **D.J. Eliot** and **Taver Johnson** each have multiple years of experience at the college level.

It was inevitable that the Eagles’ cap situation would mean the loss of multiple key players. And indeed, 5 of the Eagles’ top 8 defensive players by snaps played, along with their starting RB and RG, would all leave.

But rather than trying to chase big names through free agency or the trade market, the Eagles opted for a more cautious approach: finding players who were about to hit their prime, had a strong college/draft pedigree and/or some flashes of NFL talent, and may have been devalued because of injury concerns, and signing them to 1-year, low guarantee deals.  The big money they did throw around was used to re-sign key veterans.

The biggest free agency splurge was QB **Marcus Mariota**, for just 1 year at $5M. While this might seem curious to outsiders given the eventual Jalen Hurts extension, it’s not surprising to Eagles fans, who’ve seen the team put tremendous value on backup QB the past few years. (And given they won a Super Bowl with a backup QB, can you blame them?). The Eagles didn’t need major offensive improvements, but added some good lotto tickets in RBs **Rashaad Penny** and **D’Andre Swift** and WR **Olamide Zaccheaus**. Penny has flashed tremendous talent in Seattle but has been snakebitten by injury; a healthy year behind the Eagles’ OL could result in a big payday. The Eagles got Swift for cheap when he was crowded out of Detroit’s RB room; he’s flashed gamebreaking 3-down talent, but has struggled with injuries and consistency. Zaccheaus, a Philly local, adds some versatility and depth to a WR corps that struggled to produce outside of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.

On defense, the Eagles did well to retain CB James Bradberry and DT Fletcher Cox, but otherwise had to get creative to fill their defensive gaps while maintaining cap flexibility. The biggest plunge was ex-Steeler S **Terrell Edmunds**, who was certainly hurt by a cold safety market, but should be a favorite to start for a shallow S corps with his experience and versatility. DBs **Justin Evans** and **Greedy Williams** are both former 2nd rounders whose careers have been marred by injury, but are otherwise cheap gambles who could fill in as young-ish depth pieces. LB **Nicholas Morrow** was productive for Chicago in 2022 and is the most experienced LB the Eagles have, while DT **Kentavius Street** provides interior pass rushing depth.

It’s fair to say that free agency wasn’t exciting. The Eagles lost a lot of critical players and didn’t land any marquee names, nor did they bring in any guys who have consistently produced at a high level in the NFL (although I am personally bullish on Penny.) But this free agency was nonetheless a practical one. One of the reasons why they struggled after Super Bowl LII was an over-dependence on signing older free agents to multi-year contracts; when they declined and/or got hurt, they ended up being albatrosses. But the Eagles went in a different direction this offseason; not only did they largely target younger free agents, but they targeted players with good draft pedigrees, who with a bounceback year and better injury luck could turn into real contributors as they enter their prime. Furthermore, by offering lower guarantees, the Eagle will at least ensure they remain flexible roster-wise and cap-wise in case some don’t pan out, which could prove handy if the Eagles angle for a big trade down the line. Plus, thanks to their diversified approach, they should receive the maximum 4 compensatory picks for 2024.

**Draft recap**

|Pick (Round-OVR)|Player|
|:-|:-|
|1-9|Jalen Carter, DT, Georgia|
|1-30|Nolan Smith, LB, Georgia|
|3-66|Tyler Steen, OL, Alabama|
|3-67|Sydney Brown, S, Illinois|
|4-105|Kelee Ringo, CB, Georgia|
|6-188|Tanner McKee, QB, Stanford|
|7-249|Moro Ojomo, DT, Texas|

Continuing a draft trend that the Eagles largely followed in 2021 and 2022, the team focused on finding players at premium positions with great measurables and plenty of experience at high-level NCAA programs.

Drafting DT **Jalen Carter** at 9th overall fits this theme to a tee: not only was he arguably the most disruptive player on Georgia’s elite defense over the last couple years, but given the high value the Eagles put on the trenches and the thinning out of the DT corps this offseason, Carter fits both need and organizational philosophy as well. Picking fellow Bulldog EDGE **Nolan Smith** at 30 is yet another example of this approach: a Georgia Bulldog with outstanding testing who should fit well in the Eagles’ pass rushing rotation with his explosiveness.

The Eagles added OL **Tyler Steen** and S **Sydney Brown** with back-to-back 3rd round picks; both come from excellent college programs (in Brown’s case, a college that has produced many high-level DB prospects the last few years), have plenty of college experience, excellent athletic traits (apart from Steen’s arm length and Brown’s height) and the versatility that could translate well to the NFL.

What could have been a quiet Day 3 to the draft was anything but, as the Eagles moved quickly to get back into the 4th round to take CB **Kelee Ringo**, yet another toolsy athlete with high-end college experience (the Eagles’ 3rd Georgia Bulldog of the draft) and ballhawk skills, and who was rated by the consensus a couple rounds higher than his actual draft slot. QB **Tanner McKee** has prototypical size, a solid arm, and experience in a pro-style offense; even if he’s not a perfect analog of Jalen Hurts, he could still be a solid product of the QB factory. DT **Moro Ojomo** has the frame and athleticism to develop into a rotational interior rusher. Oh, and adding D’Andre Swift for pennies on the dollar gives an explosive offense another weapon.

**Draft Yelp Review:** 4.5 stars.

|QB|**Jalen Hurts**|*Marcus Mariota*|*Tanner McKee*|Ian Book|

**Yelp review:** 4.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* It’s hard to improve on form that nearly won MVP, but if there’s anyone who’s up to the task, it’s Hurts. Mariota should be an improvement over Gardner Minshew if it comes to that, but hopefully it doesn’t!

**Position battle of note**: *Tanner McKee vs. Ian Book for QB3.* Book has the edge when it comes to NFL experience, athleticism, and mobility. McKee has the edge in size and the better arm. There’s not a lot at stake here, given that QB1 and QB2 are set, but it will make preseason a little more interesting. Hopefully it’s more compelling than Carson Strong vs. Reid Sinnett.

|RB|**D’Andre Swift**|*Rashaad Penny*|*Kenny Gainwell*|*Boston Scott*|Trey Sermon|Kennedy Brooks|

**Yelp rating:** 3.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Yes.* RB is the position group with the best chance to be more productive in 2023 than they were in 2022. That’s saying something given that Miles Sanders put up big numbers in his own right, but when healthy Swift and Penny both have the potential to be better. Even if neither achieves Miles’s numbers individually, the ground game should be even more dynamic.

**Position battle of note:** *D’Andre Swift vs. Rashaad Penny vs. Kenny Gainwell for RB1.* Emphasis on the former two - Swift is capable of playing 3 downs and Penny has a tremendous combo of size and speed. Gainwell has shown some playmaking ability in the limited reps he’s gotten, but he doesn’t have RB1 size and Swift is already a better receiver, so he’s more of a distant favorite.

|WR|**DeVonta Smith**|Deon Cain|Charleston Rambo|*Britain Covey*|
|Slot|**Quez Watkins**|*Olamide Zaccheaus*|Greg Ward|Jadon Haselwood|

**Yelp rating**: 4 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* The top 3 haven’t changed, and while Olamide Zaccheaus is a better receiver than Zach Pascal, he doesn’t provide the same all-around contribution that Pascal did. So any improvement is dependent on a bounceback from Quez Watkins or a breakthrough from one of the UDFAs.

**Position battle of note**: Quez Watkins vs. Olamide Zaccheaus for WR3. Quez has the size, speed, and incumbency advantage, and has a past track record of production in this offense. Zaccheaus is more versatile, can be more of a downfield threat, and had the more productive season last year, which is remarkable when you consider Atlanta’s hesitancy to pass.

|TE|**Dallas Goedert**|*Jack Stoll*|*Grant Calcaterra*|Dan Arnold|Tyree Jackson|Brady Russell|

**Yelp rating**: 4 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Maybe.* This answer depends on both the health of Dallas Goedert and the progression of Grant Calcaterra. If Goedert can play a full 17-game schedule, then yes. If Calcaterra can find some snaps as a productive backup, that’s an even bigger yes. But nothing is likely to change beyond that.

**Position battle of note**: Grant Calcaterra vs. Dan Arnold for backup receiving TE. Calcaterra’s 2022 camp was interrupted by a hamstring injury, and he never got in a rhythm on offense despite the Eagles giving him a part snap share. (Even the Goedert injury didn’t give him much of a boost.) Dan Arnold isn’t exactly daunting competition, but his floor could be higher than Calcaterra’s as a receiver. With Dallas Goedert and Jack Stoll firmly the top 2 TEs, this is the best shot either player has of getting onto the active roster.

|RG|**Cam Jurgens**|Dennis Kelly|Tyrese Robinson||
|RT|**Lane Johnson**|*Jack Driscoll*|Fred Johnson|Chim Okorafor|

**Yelp rating**: 4.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* It’s hard to improve from being the best, and they’ll have to replace RG, likely with someone without extensive NFL experience. If they can get solid play from their new RG, plus more consistent play from Landon Dickerson and Jordan Mailata, plus continued All-Pro form from Lane Johnson and Jason Kelce, then they could surpass last year’s level. But that’s a tough needle to thread.

**Position battle of note**: Cam Jurgens vs. Tyler Steen vs. Jack Driscoll for RG. This is the first real starting OL position battle in a while, as the Mailata/Dillard LT battle in 2021 was a farce. Jurgens was drafted last year as Kelce’s heir apparent at C, and looked good in preseason; the main question is if he has the size to play anywhere but C, but on the Eagles’ website, Jurgens is listed at the same weight that Seumalo played at last year, and his arm length isn’t far off Seumalo’s either. Steen might have the most upside with his athleticism and size, but the Eagles don’t prefer to start rookies on the OL; furthermore, Steen doesn’t have experience on the interior and the Eagles may prefer him to be more of a utility player who can play at LT. Driscoll doesn’t get much mention as a prospective starter, but he does at least have the highest floor if neither of the other two shines in camp. (Although I think he’s a much longer shot than the other two, as the Eagles value him as a utility reserve.)

|NT|**Jordan Davis**|*Marlon Tulipulotu*|Noah Elliss|||
|DT|**Fletcher Cox**|*Jalen Carter*|*Milton Williams*|Kentavius Street|*Moro Ojomo*|

**Yelp rating**: 3.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *No.* Javon Hargrave is a major loss, and even if Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh didn’t offer much more than veteran depth, they were still instrumental in the Eagles’ Super Bowl run. We could certainly see Jordan Davis begin to realize his massive potential this year in a new scheme that uses more of his NT skills. And Jalen Carter could be the real deal from Week 1. And one of the young reserve DTs like Milton Williams, Marlon Tulipulotu, or Moro Ojomo could take a big step forward. But that’s asking a lot.

**Position battle of note**: Milton Williams vs. Kentavius Street vs. Moro Ojomo et al. for backup 3-technique DT. Jordan Davis will likely handle the starting NT role, and Carter and Fletcher Cox will likely rotate in alongside him, with the two playing together in passing situations. But beyond that, there's a lot of rotational snaps available. Williams has incredible athletic potential - his pre-draft testing was comparable to Aaron Donald’s - but hasn’t found more than a part role as an interior rusher and has yet to show the size needed to play every down. Street can rush the passer, but offers little as a run stopper. Ojomo could be the best run stopper of the lot, but he’s a rookie and ideally needs to add weight. (I mentioned Marlon Tulipulotu before, but he’s more of a run-stopping NT like Davis, albeit smaller.)

|DE|**Josh Sweat**|*Brandon Graham*|*Derek Barnett*|Janarius Robinson|Tarron Jackson|
|SLB|**Haason Reddick**|*Nolan Smith*|*Patrick Johnson*|Kyron Johnson||

**Yelp rating**: 5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* Again, improving from being the best is hard. Haason Reddick and Josh Sweat are bona fide pass rushers in their prime, and if the Eagles can manage Brandon Graham’s snaps again, he should remain highly efficient, even if another double digit sack season is unlikely. Any improvement is mainly dependent on how quickly Nolan Smith makes an impact. Robert Quinn looked like great EDGE depth on paper last year when he was acquired, but was a disappointment; if Smith can make plays on sheer burst and football instincts while developing his pass rushing repertoire, he’ll be an upgrade on Quinn, and this could be the scariest position group in the NFL.

**Position battle of note**: *Nolan Smith vs. Patrick Johnson vs. Kyron Johnson for backup SAM.* There’s no disputing that Haason Reddick will dominate snaps here. Patrick Johnson is the incumbent after winning the backup role with a strong 2022 camp, but he managed just 7 pressures on 213 defensive snaps and has 0 sacks in 2 years, although he’s become a core special teamer. Smith has the edge in athleticism, pedigree, and ceiling, but still faces a learning curve in the NFL possibly amplified by his size. Kyron Johnson lost the backup SAM battle to Patrick Johnson in 2022; like Nolan Smith, he’s an undersized EDGE with great athleticism, but doesn’t have the high-end college experience that Smith had and is even more undersized than Smith.

|MLB|**Nakobe Dean**|*Shaun Bradley*|*Davion Taylor*|
|WLB|**Nicholas Morrow**|*Christian Elliss*|Ben VanSumeren|

**Yelp rating:** 2 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *No.* T.J. Edwards and Kyzir White were solid every-down players; Edwards was a constant playmaker while White was rock steady in coverage. Even if you’re optimistic about Dean being an impact player this year (which he looked like in limited snaps) there’s still plenty of questions about who will start along side him - and who will play behind him.

**Position battle of note**: *I dunno, basically all of them?* Apart from Dean, the depth chart is wide open. Morrow is the favorite to start alongside Dean thanks to his experience. Elliss burst onto the scene with an impressive 9 tackles in garbage time reps in his first 2 NFL games, but is more suited for special teams at this point. Bradley is a core special teamer who has rarely seen defensive action since being picked in 2020. Taylor made 6 starts in 2021 and has incredible athleticism, but he didn’t even make the active roster in 2022 and might never be able to process NFL speed. VanSumeren is an undrafted rookie.

|CB|**James Bradberry**|*Kelee Ringo*|Mario Goodrich|Eli Ricks|
|Slot|**Avonte Maddox**|*Zech McPhearson*|Josiah Scott||

**Yelp rating**: 4.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not*. That’s partly a testament to how good Darius Slay, James Bradberry, and Avonte Maddox were last year. But Darius Slay is 32 and James Bradberry is 30, so there’s a risk of them hitting a wall (which Slay did for a chunk of the latter half of 2022), and none of the CBs behind these 2 are proven on the outside at the NFL level. Any hope in a step up comes from better injury luck for Maddox (who missed 8 games in 2022) and any of the other CBs on the roster stepping up.

**Position battle of note**: *Any roster slots past the top 4 CBs*. Slay, Bradberry, and Maddox are the locked-in starters, and Zech McPhearson has been a key special teamer with outside CB potential who has gotten some slot looks in OTAs. Beyond that, it’s going to be a dogfight for backup spots. The incumbents are Josh Jobe (backup outside and special teamer) and Josiah Scott (backup slot CB and occasional deep safety) but Kelee Ringo should fit in somewhere as a developmental player, and Greedy Williams should both have a chance to compete, and there are a slew of 2022 and 2023 UDFAs ready for a fight.

|FS|**Reed Blankenship**|*Justin Evans*|Tristin McCollum|

**Yelp rating**: 3 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Probably not.* CJGJ was a dynamic playmaker who will be tough to replace. And even if Epps was unremarkable, he wasn’t necessarily someone who hurt a defense. Terrell Edmunds has good experience, Blankenship showed some flashes as a rookie, and Brown has tremendous athleticism, so it’s not like they couldn’t put together a decent safety corps with that. Plus, with such a strong CB tandem, at least some of the pressure will be taken off them. It’s just that it’s hard to project them having the collective impact Epps and CJGJ provided.

**Position battle of note**: *Terrell Edmunds vs. Reed Blankenship vs. Sydney Brown for starting S roles.* Edmunds's 75 starts are nearly triple the total of the rest of the S corps, and he's a former 1st rounder who can play in a variety of positions, but he didn't get any big bonus, so he's not a stone cold lock to start. Blankenship looked good when he filled in for CJGJ during the season, and has plenty of college experience, a knack for the ball, and good all-around athleticism, but it's unknown how much his aggressiveness will hurt him once teams have more tape on him. Brown is a tremendous athlete and was highly productive at Illinois, but his length could be an issue.

|KR|*Boston Scott*|*Britain Covey*|*Quez Watkins*|

**Yelp rating**: 3.5 stars.

**Will they be better than last year?** *Maybe.* The 2022 Eagles’ special teams were simply bad before turning things around in the second half of the year. In a way, some credit needs to be given to STs coordinator Michael Clay, as the Eagles haven’t added special teams specialists (e.g. Chris Maragos or Bryan Braman) in a long time, relying on young defensive reserves to learn the scheme, so getting even average special teams performances is a plus. If they can play like they did in the latter half of last year, they’ll be in a much better position. There’s little concern about Jake Elliott; the low number of FGs he attempted was due to the aggressiveness and efficiency of the offense, not a lack of trust in his leg. And punting can hopefully only get better.

**Position battle of note**: Arryn Siposs vs. Ty Zentner for starting P. Yes, it’s the most notable position battle because it’s the only position battle, but it’s at least of interest for Eagles fans. Siposs has been a below-average punter in his first 2 NFL seasons. Zentner flashed a strong leg in college, but faces similar concerns over consistency.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15i14ya,0.85,False,1691158221.0

Division: AFC East

2022 Record: 13-3 1st in AFCE

Postseason: Lost in divisional round to Bengals

# Coaching Changes:

**Leslie Frazier (Defensive Coordinator/Assistant Head Coach) departure:**

The biggest coaching move of the offseason came when the Bills announced that Leslie Frazier, the defensive coordinator for that past five (5) seasons, was ""stepping back from football"" for the upcoming season. After the announcement was made, Brandon Beane (Bills GM) and co. spoke in a manner consistent with this verbiage that implied the move was Frazier's and not a team-forced decision. However, since his resignation Frazier has been reported to have visited with other teams within the league. Therefore it's fair to speculate whether the decision was entirely Frazier's to leave his post. One way or another the time had come for a change at the helm of this Bills defense. During his tenure as the Bills DC, Frazier led ""elite"" regular season defenses that were ultimately paper tigers against the league's better offensive units. There's no better evidence to this point than the last three Bills playoff exits in which Frazier's defenses have allowed an **average of** **36 points and 468 yards** in those games, one of which was the infamous 13 seconds debacle. In short, it was time for Frazier to go. His defensive philosophy of ""bend but don't break"", the lack of aggressiveness from the defensive front, and the utilization of prevent defense all really held back some otherwise talented Bills teams. With that being said, his leadership within the building and his years of experience will be missed by the organization.

**Sean McDermott new defensive play caller:**

Head Coach Sean McDermott has assumed the role of defensive play caller for the Bills' 23-24 season. He last called plays as the DC for the Carolina Panthers from 2011-2017, which includes the Panthers 2015 Super Bowl run. When you factor in McDermott's defensive background and the need at DC he  was the obvious choice to replace Frazier, especially considering the awkward timing of Frazier's departure. The news of Frazier's departure broke on February 28 which was well into the coaching carousel. (For perspective, the 'Niners hired former Panthers interim HC Steve Wilks as their new DC on February 7, and the Miami Dolphins hired Vic Fangio on February 15). At this point in the offseason most if not all of the established DC's that had been available were scooped up, and so the Bills either had to choose from within or search the remainder of the market. They chose the former and went with their head coach. There are two questions whose answers will prove to be the most vital to the success or failure of his unit in 2023:

1. How well does he function as both the head coach and the defensive play caller?

First and foremost, this will be McDermott's first season as *both* head coach and defensive coordinator. How well does he balance both roles, and can he be an effective head coach as well as an effective defensive coordinator? McDermott as a head coach has many strengths but one of his weaknesses is game management, which doesn't become easier when you add play calling to his game day responsibilities. This is where the Bills coaching staff that they have built around McDermott will benefit him greatly. For the game management component Marc Lubick is on staff as the Bills game management coach. For the defensive responsibilities the Bills have several coaches in the room who have functioned as defensive coordinators in the league (e.g. Al Holcomb, Eric Washington), so he has strong support in handling those duties as well. If McDermott is going to succeed as the Bills defensive coordinator he appears to have the personal talent, past experience, and necessary support to do so.

2. How much of the defense in past seasons was McDermott responsible for?

We don't know how much of the recent defensive failures were McDermott's fault. Leslie Frazier may have been the defensive coordinator, but McDermott is a veteran DC in the league and head coach of this team, so it's fair to assume he had input into defensive scheming and game planning. Also, during this offseason there's been a report that McDermott took over play calling during the 13 seconds debacle. We may never know if that's true or not, but this season will at least tell us how much of McDermott's influence has permeated this defense in the recent seasons. If the defense shows the same inconsistencies and lapses that it did in 2022, then it's fair to be concerned about whether or not a McDermott-led defense can bring a Super Bowl to Buffalo.

**Eric Washington promoted to Assistant Head Coach/Defensive Line Coach:**

Washington has been the Bills defensive line coach since 2020 and has served as a senior defensive assistant. Washington will now assume Frazier's former role of assistant head coach. Washington coached alongside McDermott in Carolina from 2011-2017, and following McDermott's departure Washington took over as defensive coordinator for the Panthers. Washington and McDermott's time on task and familiarity together should aid in his transition to assistant head coach. Also, as previously stated Washington has time as an NFL DC which should aid coach McDermott in his transition to play calling.

**Jim Salgado (safeties coach) fired:**

The first staff change of the offseason came only days after the bludgeoning at the hands of the Bengals, as it was announced that Salgado had been relieved of his position as safeties coach. Salgado had been with the Bills since McDermott's arrival in Buffalo in 2017. This one's a bit of a head scratcher. Salgado served as the team's nickel coach for the 2021/2022 campaign where Taron Johnson really broke out as a premier slot CB. During the 2022 offseason he was transitioned from nickel coach to the safeties coach. The 2022 season saw the top three safeties on the team experience significant injuries which really hurt the position group, then only days after the playoff ousting he was let go from the team. It's hard to blame him for the pitfalls of his position group within the context of the season, but clearly the team saw fit to make the change.

**Joe Danna (safeties coach) hired:**

Danna has been a defensive backs coach in the league since 2008 and most recently served as the Houston Texans safeties coach in 2022.

**Al Holcomb hired as senior defensive assistant:**

Al Holcomb joins the Bills defensive coaching staff after spending the last three seasons with the Carolina Panthers as their defensive run game coordinator. He also had a brief stint as the interim defensive coordinator in the 2022 season after the firing of Panthers head coach Matt Rhule and defensive coordinator Phil Snow. As with Washington, Holcomb coached alongside Sean McDermott in Carolina when Holcomb was the linebackers coach there from 2013-2017. Holcomb's resume includes coaching the elite linebacker tandem of Thomas Davis and Luke Keuchly. With the team in limbo at the linebacker position (more on that later), Holcomb will surely bring invaluable coaching to a position group that arguably will need the most coaching of the 2023 Bills roster.

**Chad Hall (wide receivers coach) departure**:

Chad Hall joined the Bills as an offensive assistant with the new regime in 2017, and in 2019 assumed the role of wide receivers coach. Hall was highly respected within the organization and a well-liked member of the coaching staff. His contract expired at the end of 2022/2023 and he signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the same role. There hasn't been a lot of information available on the circumstances surrounding Hall's departure. Regardless, losing Hall was a big loss within the building, not only because of the length of his tenure but also the respect and admiration he commanded from the players.

**Adam Henry hired as new wide receivers coach:**

Henry joins the Bills after most recently coaching at the University of Indiana as a co-offensive coordinator and receivers coach. He also has multiple stops in the NFL as WR coach, serving tenures with San Francisco, NY Giants, Cleveland Browns, and the Dallas Cowboys. In joining the Bills, Henry will be tasked with getting the most out of guys who to this point have mostly been supporting cast in the league.

Most notable FA losses:

**Tremaine Edmunds** **(LB)** \- Edmunds was drafted in the first round of the 2018 NFL draft at pick 16 overall and was Brandon Beane's second ever draft pick as GM of the Buffalo Bills (the first was none other than Josh Allen). Edmunds entered the league as a young athletic phenom with unlimited upside and has been the Bills starting MLB ever since. The Bills exercised his fifth year option for 2022 and a contract extension never materialized. Edmunds proceeded to have arguably the best season of his career in 2022 and in free agency signed a four year, $72M contract with the Chicago Bears. Edmunds has been the most polarizing player among Bills fans in recent memory, as Bills fans are deeply divided on his performance and necessity to this team. The critics of Edmunds have been frustrated by his lack of consistency in run fits and block shedding in the run game. For a player with ""elite physical traits"" he seemingly is incapable of shedding blocks and gets swallowed at the line of scrimmage far too often. Also, there have been multiple instances of Edmunds initiating contact close to the line of scrimmage and subsequently getting dragged by the running back for additional yards. But it is possible that this lack of consistency is explained by two truths about the Bills defense. First, the Bills defense runs predominantly through a nickel base, so Edmunds has routinely operated as just one of two linebackers on the field, playing in a light box even on running downs. Second, the defensive line in front of Edmunds has never been stellar. In fact one of the most glaring weaknesses that this team has had over the course of his time in Buffalo has been a lack of a quality defensive line in front of him. The strength of Edmunds game, on the other hand, is his effectiveness in the passing game; he uses his 6'5"" frame and 83"" wingspan to severely limit what opposing quarterbacks are able to accomplish in the middle of the field, and his 80.4 passer rating allowed against his coverage in 2022 supports that. Consequently the Bills have overall been a very good team against opposing tight ends during his time in Buffalo. Edmunds would have been a quality free agent signing for Buffalo if he could have been had for a reasonable salary. He offers multiple qualities that will be difficult to replace, most notably his availability (he only missed six games in five seasons) and leadership. Ultimately Edmunds went out and got paid, and the Bills are left searching for the new answer at MLB. Without signing Edmunds, Brandon Beane has allocated cap space to other position groups and he is hedging that McDermott will get similar production from the defense while utilizing a different option at MLB.

&amp;#x200B;

**Devin Singletary (RB) -** Devin Singletary signed a one year $3.75M contract with the Houston Texans this offseason after his rookie contract with the Bills expired. Singletary leaves the Bills after being the team's leading rusher over the past four seasons, posting a respectable 4.7 yards per carry over that time. The Bills need more from their running game though and ultimately Singletary does not offer a skillset that can do that. He's an average to below-average athlete who's skillset is more fitting of a complimentary RB2 rather than the premier running back in one of the league's best offenses. The Bills drafted James Cook in the second round of last year's draft and it would appear that the RB1 role is his to lose.

&amp;#x200B;

**Isaiah McKenzie (WR)** \- McKenzie's five year run with the Bills ended in March one year into a two year contract he signed last offseason. McKenzie replaced Cole Beasley heading into the 2022 season as the team's primary slot option at wide receiver and he caught 42 of 65 targets for 423 yards and 4 touchdowns. McKenzie had displayed flashes of brilliance in limited opportunities in the years prior, and so the hope among Bills fans was that McKenzie would provide at least comparable production to what they got out of Beasley. The experiment ultimately did not work out, and in fact the Bills were so desperate for quality slot play that they signed Beasley out of retirement in an attempt to provide a spark for the Bills asynchronous offense. The Bills now move forward with 2022 fifth round receiver Khalil Shakir penciled in as WR3 on the depth chart.

Most notable FA signings:

**Jordan Poyer (S) -** Jordan Poyer has been among the league's best strong safeties for quite some time now, and he is part of an elite safety tandem with his running mate Micah Hyde. When the season ended and Poyer became an unrestricted free agent much of Bills Mafia did not expect to see the veteran safety re-sign with the Bills due to the contract he was reported to be after and the Bills lack of cap space. Poyer tested the market and ended up re-signing with the Bills on a two year deal for $12.5M. Poyer has led the Bills in interceptions in four of his six seasons as a member of the defense, and he brings exceptional coverage skills and physicality to the unit. He's vital to the operation of this defense; it's no coincidence that the Bills were undefeated during the regular season in 2022 when he was in the lineup. Bringing back Poyer was the most important signing of the offseason, especially considering the turnover at MLB and DC.

**Poona Ford (DT)** \- After signing on with the Bills this offseason Ford admitted he passed over more lucrative offers to join this unit, and this is a unit that will gladly welcome his talents to the middle of their defensive line. The Bills entered 2022 with Daquan Jones, Tim Settle, Jordan Phillips, and Ed Oliver as their primary defensive tackles. Ed Oliver continued to show flashes of the athletic disruptive pass rusher that earned him a top 10 overall pick, but far too often he was completely neutralized by the opposing OL and inconsistency continues to plague him. Daquan Jones was the Bills best defensive lineman and didn't miss a single game during the regular season but missed the Bengals playoff matchup. Tim Settle spent most of the season battling injury but was a disappointment in his first year with the Bills. And as always Jordan Phillips couldn't stay healthy to be part of the lineup to contribute in a meaningful fashion. Ford should be able to come in at NT as a day one starter and either absorb double teams to free up Oliver or create disruption in the pocket himself. This is arguably the Bills second most important signing of the offseason.

**Leonard Floyd (OLB)** \- When you look at the last three Bills postseason losses, one of the common themes among those games was inability to generate pressure on the quarterback. Both Mahomes and Burrow enjoyed comfortable pockets to throw from while the Bills defensive line failed to generate meaningful pressure to influence the game. Well this offseason Beane has taken another stab at attempting to correct this deficiency. Floyd comes to the Bills on a one year contract after posting three consecutive seasons with at least nine sacks, including one year which ended in a Super Bowl victory. Beane and co. hope that Floyd brings his Super Bowl pedigree to Buffalo to not only generate pressure with this unit, but also to help bridge the gap between the start of the season and when Von Miller returns to form in his recovery from a torn ACL.

**Connor McGovern (OG)** \- The Bills continue to throw resources at their defensive and offensive lines in hopes to finally get the right personnel in place. The offensive line is better than it was in that 2020 beatdown by the Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game, but it still has not been up to snuff over these past two seasons. Dion Dawkins (LT) and Mitch Morse (C) consistently perform at exceptional levels for their respective positions, but have dealt with a carousel of ineptitude around them at the other positions on the line. The likes of Roger Saffold, Jon Feliciano, Ike Boettger, and Cody Ford have all started for this unit and failed to perform at a level worthy of protecting franchise quarterback Josh Allen. Insert Connor McGovern, an athletic offensive lineman who has quietly improved every season in the league and become a quality NFL guard. McGovern most likely inserts into the LG spot in this line and seeks to anchor a position that hasn't been anchored in front of Allen during any of his tenure in Buffalo.

# 2023 Draft

|Round|Number|Player|Postion|School|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|25|Dalton Kincaid|TE|Utah|
|2|59|O'Cyrus Torrence|OG|Florida|
|3|91|Dorian Williams|LB|Tulane|

|7|230|Nick Broeker|OL|Ole Miss|
|7|252|Alex Austin|CB|Oregon State|

&amp;#x200B;

**Pick 1.25 (25) Dalton Kincaid**

The Bills made Kincaid the first tight end taken in the 2023 draft when they leapfrogged the Dallas Cowboys to select him at pick 25 overall. Following the selection Brandon Beane said he ""had a good feeling Dallas would take him"" which prompted the exchange of their first and fourth round picks with the Jacksonville Jaguars to move up two spots to grab him.  Beane describes him as ""Cole Beasley in a different body type"" and specifically referenced Kincaid's elite hands as reasons they love this player. The need for this pick was clear: Josh Allen's limited receiving options after Stefon Diggs hamstrung the offense throughout the season. In the Bills week nine loss to the Jets, Diggs tallied five catches for 93 yards and zero touchdowns. The second leading receiver on the team that day was Gabe Davis who caught two passes for 33 yards. Fast forward to Bills vs. Bengals in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. While the Bengals were absolutely teeing off on the Bills secondary with their elite receiving group of Chase-Higgins-Boyd, Dawson Knox led the Bills in receiving yards on five catches for 65 yards, with rookie Khalil Shakir coming in second on the day with two catches for 40 yards. The point is, if this offense is going to perform at a championship level they needed at least one more talented pass catcher in the room. While tight end is typically a slow developing position in the NFL (e.g. Knox didn't see his breakout season until year three), Kincaid's time to maturity within the offense could be shortened based on the fact that he's going to be playing more of a receiver role in the offense as opposed to the traditional in-line tight end. Therefore, ideally he integrates into the offense quicker and by the end of year one becomes an impact playmaker. Look for Kincaid to be deployed as part of 12 personnel packages and in multiple alignments to maximize mismatches with the defense in both the run and pass attacks.

**Pick 2.28 (59) O'Cyrus Torrence**

O'Cyrus Torrence went from a projected day one draft pick to being selected at the end of the second round by the Buffalo Bills. One of the speculated reasons for this fall is a concerning medical evaluation due to his size, being listed at 6'5"" and 330 pounds. But Torrence has a heart warming background story of using football as motivation to lose weight, and so he has a factor that the Bills have shown to highly covet since Beane and McDermott have taken over; they love players who have had to fight to overcome adversity. If Torrence plays to the potential he flashed in 2022 at Florida, then their investment into this young man will have more than paid off. In 2022 Torrence earned first team AP All-American and first team All-SEC accolades for his performance protecting eventual first round draft pick Anthony Richardson. Perhaps the most impressive feat of this campaign though was his handling of Jalen Carter in Florida's matchup versus the Georgia Bulldogs. Not many players can say they neutralized Carter, but Torrence handled him that day and put a stamp of authenticity on his pedigree as one of college football's elite guard prospects of the 2023 draft. Torrence is a mauler of a guard who brings toughness and physicality to an offensive line desperately needing those qualities. In 2023 Torrence will be competing with proven veterans Connor McGovern, Ryan Bates, Ike Boettger, and David Edwards for a starting guard spot in the Bills offensive line. Should he beat out these veterans and earn a starting spot on Kromer's unit, look for him to be an immediate impact starter.

**Pick 3.28 (91) Dorian Williams**

From the moment Tremaine Edmunds signed with the Chicago Bears, Bills fans have anxiously awaited a move at linebacker to provide some clarity at the position. Veteran linebackers signed elsewhere in free agency and the Bills entered the draft with middle linebacker as the team's most glaring remaining need. At the end of day two Beane finally made a move and drafted Tulane's Dorian Williams with the team's third round pick. Williams, listed at 6'1"" and 228 pounds with a 33 3/4"" arm length, is an above-average athlete with a knack for tackling. Williams was a three year starter at Tulane at the middle linebacker position, leading the AAC in tackles in 2020 and winning defensive MVP of the 2022 Cotton Bowl against USC following a 17 tackle performance. Despite his stellar tackling ability, he is below average size for his position and struggles with handling blocks. In pass coverage Williams has displayed sufficient coverage abilities that could bolster his appeal as the day one starter for the Bills defense. After the draft the Bills staff indicated that he would start off working behind veteran Matt Milano as an off-ball linebacker, but since then all indications are that he is in the mix to compete for the starting middle linebacker job. Williams will at least contribute to the 2023 Buffalo Bills as a special teams player, but don't write him off as an option to see meaningful minutes at MLB this season as the defense tries to find the long-term replacement for Tremaine Edmunds.

**Pick 5.15 (150) Justin Shorter**

Justin Shorter is a sure-handed, big-bodied receiver whose physical measurements and skillset are primarily geared towards being a deep jump ball threat. In 2022 Shorter caught 29 of 51 passes for 577 yards and 2 touchdowns with a 0% drop rate. 351 of his 577 receiving yards (61%) were from deep balls and his yards per catch averaged 19.9 yards. His best chance at making the active roster will be to make quick gains in his route running ability as well as proving himself a reliable deep option for Josh Allen. However, his athletic limitations may prove too difficult to overcome for his chances as a vertical threat in the NFL, as his 4.55 second 40 time at the NFL combine reinforces the questions regarding his ability to win vertical routes with speed. Shorter is currently penciled in as WR6 on the Bills depth chart and will be a fringe player come roster cutdown day. Should he make the roster his most likely utilization will be a limited role with most of the season spent as a healthy scratch on game days.

**Pick 7.13 (230) Nick Broeker**

Nick Broeker was a three season starter at Ole Miss, playing 13 games at left guard and 23 games at left tackle. Broeker didn't miss a single game due to injury during his time at Ole Miss and was named second team All-SEC for his 2022 performance in which he allowed zero sacks on 435 pass blocking reps. Brandon Beane is always looking for quality talent in the trenches, so it's not surprise that he took the swing on an offensive line talent who projected to be taken earlier than the seventh round. Broeker's most likely path to the active roster is through injuries in training camp and the preseason, but he at least comes to camp with the opportunity to compete for a spot on the practice squad.

**Pick 7.35 (252) Alex Austin**

Alex Austin played four years at Oregon State and was a full time starter for the last two of those. He is a versatile cornerback who is able to play in both man and zone coverage schemes and offers average athleticism for his position. Austin joins a crowded CB room and is a long shot to make the Bills active roster, but could be a candidate to be signed to the practice squad.

##Coaching Changes

The 49ers coaching staff lost a few key pieces in former DC **DeMeco Ryans** and former Director of Player Personnel **Ran Carthon**, who both moved to higher roles, becoming Houston's head coach and Tennessee's GM respectively. Both will be missed as they were outstanding during their time with the 49ers. As well, offensive passing game coordinator **Bobby Slowik** left to become Ryans' OC in Houston.

To replace Ryans and Slowik, the 49ers turned to **Steve Wilks** and **Klint Kubiak** for the roles. They also added **Jacob Webster** and **Cameron Brown** as Defensive Quality coaches.

###Steve Wilks

Previously, as Shanahan's head coaching tree grew, the 49ers preferred to hire new coordinators from within to keep the same scheme. That makes sense, since the 49ers defense has consistently been excellent, and why mess with what's working? However, they instead went outside the organization to hire experienced DC and former head coach Steve Wilks. Wilks took a Panthers team that was going nowhere fast and nearly got them to the playoffs, and his players seemed [to really like him](https://www.outkick.com/carolina-panthers-players-want-steve-wilks-to-be-their-permanent-head-coach/).

I'll talk more about the likely changes Wilks will bring to the 49ers defense below. In short, I think Wilks will likely add some new ideas to the 49ers defense while keeping the majority of what made it so good. Combined with his experience in leading a locker room, and I think this is a very solid hire and as good an outside candidate as the 49ers could have hoped for. **Grade: A**

###Klint Kubiak

Klint joins his brother, Klay, a defensive quality control coach for the Niners and the second most popular Klay in the Bay Area. Klint has experience at this role, but it isn't necessarily the best experience - he was QBs coach in Denver when they developed... Paxton Lynch and Brock Osweilier. Then he was briefly OC in Minnesota before returning to Denver under... Nathaniel Hackett. At least the offense improved somewhat when he took over playcalling duties. Still, experience is always nice, and Klint will be learning from the master that is Kyle Shanahan, so honestly, this doesn't seem like a bad hire to me. **Grade: B**

###Jacob Webster and Cameron Brown

I honestly don't really know what to think of these hires. Both have no NFL experience and come from the college ranks, but they don't exactly have critical roles - they seem to be the coaching equivalents of future prospects. So, we'll see? **Grade: B**

###Ji-Ayir Brown

The Niners lost Jimmie Ward in free agency, but their earliest pick in the draft has a ton of similarities to Ward. He's a ball-hawking safety who also played some at nickel cornerback at Penn State, who plays faster than he runs on the track due to fantastic instincts and a nose for the ball. While his ultimate role on the team is probably as a replacement for Tashaun Gipson Sr. after Gipson's one-year deal is up, Brown should contribute this year as well, whether it's challenging Isaiah Oliver for the starting Nickel Cornerback role, or on special teams, or simply as a depth piece. **GRADE: A+**

###Jake Moody

Say what you will about taking a kicker in the third round - and there's plenty to say about it. The last kicker taken as highly, Roberto Aguayo, was out of the league after a year, while the greatest kicker in NFL history, Justin Tucker, went undrafted. Kicker is pretty much a crapshoot - it's not possible to tell from someone's college performance what they'll do in the NFL.

But the 49ers got their guy here. Moody is, by all accounts, a stud with ice water in his veins. He immediately takes over for the departing Robbie Gould. And it is a testimony to how badly teams wanted him, according to John Lynch, [other teams were trying to trade up for him](https://ninernoise.com/posts/real-story-49ers-drafted-kicker-jake-moody), and the Patriots took the second best kicker in the draft, Chad Ryland, just 13 picks later.

If Moody lives up to the hype, the pick will have been worth it. But if not, this pick will start to look really bad, especially with a glaring need at offensive line which the 49ers did nothing to address. **GRADE: B-**

###Cameron Latu

The 49ers have been trying to get a strong tight end to pair with George Kittle for a while now. It's just not clear that Latu moves the needle. He regressed last year at Alabama, with 30 catches on 49 targets for half the TDs he had in 2021. He has the size and athleticism to play TE, but it's not clear he'll be an NFL-worthy receiver at the position. He should have an inside track to the 49ers number two tight end role, but whether he'll make more out of it than Charlie Woerner is an open question **GRADE: C+**

###Darrell Luter Jr.

Luter also took a step back from a strong 2021 to have just a solid 2022, though a solid Senior Bowl performance put him on the 49ers radar. He, like Latu, has the physical tools to play his position, and by all accounts is a high character guy, but whether he can produce right away is a bigger question. He can likely contribute at special teams, so he has a good shot to make the roster, but if the Niners are relying on him at CB, it'll mean the position curse is acting up again. **GRADE: B-**

###Robert Beal Jr.

Beal had the opposite problem to Luter - rather than being the big fish in a relatively small pond, he was buried on the stacked Georgia depth chart after being a highly recruited prospect and whose production diminished accordingly. He has all the physical traits you want at the position, so the 49ers and Kris Kocurek will be trying to unlock that high pedigree and those immense athletic gifts, but Beal is likely at best a special teams or depth contributor at best at this point. Don't be surprised if he's off the team in two years - but also don't be too surprised if he's starting opposite Nick Bosa in two years. **GRADE: C**

###Dee Winters

Winters is in a pretty enviable position, joining a stacked position group with little pressure to contribute right away but the potential to learn from the best. Unlike the last few Niners picks, Winters was a very high-production player in college, leading TCU to the National Championship game last year (uh, don't look up how that went for them). He started his career as a safety and projects to the NFL as a WILL or SAM linebacker as he is strong in coverage but lacks the size to play inside, but he also has the ability to shoot gaps on blitzes and support the pass rush. He'll likely stick to special teams his first year, but he could be a long-term asset for the 49ers. **GRADE: B+**

###Brayden Willis

Willis isn't the best receiving tight end, but he does have a possible role with the team - as the heir apparent to Kyle Juscsyzk. He's a great blocker and can turn into an excellent jack-of-all-trades on offense, and the 49ers may want to convert him into more of a fullback role moving forward. **GRADE: B**

###Ronnie Bell

Bell's best attribute is his catching ability, though he lacks the top-end speed to have too much upside as a regular WR. He may be able to fill a Jauan Jennings role in short yardage, and he also has some experience catching punts, giving him a few possible paths to making the roster, but a stint on the practice squad is more likely. **GRADE: B-**.

###Jalen Graham

The Niners apparently liked both Graham and Winters quite a bit, but it sure is a stacked linebacker room at this point. Graham will need to contribute on special teams to make the roster, but again, I think the practice squad is his more likely destination. But you never know... after all, he was taken 7 picks ahead of Brock Purdy, so obviously he's better right? **Grade: B**

## Undrafted Free Agents

Player | Position | College
------|--------|-------
Ronald Awatt | RB | UTEP
Jack Colletto | FB? | Oregon State
Joey Fisher | OL | Shepherd
D'Shawn Jamison | CB | Texas
Khalan Laborn | RB | Marshall
Corey Luciano | OL | Washington
Ilm Manning | OL | Hawaii
Mariano Sori-Marin | LB | Minnesota
Spencer Waege | DL | North Dakota State
Shae Wyatt | WR | Tulane
Avery Young | S | Rutgers

Of these, the most promising and likely to make a long-term impact are probably **Jack Colletto**, **Corey Luciano**, **Ilm Manning**, **Joey Fisher**, and **Spencer Waege**. Colletto is the most interesting of these prospects as a do-everything type of player - he played FB, TE, LB, and even QB at Oregon State. In the short term, he might make the roster and find a role on special teams. In the medium to long term, he could be a replacement for Juice if that role doesn't go to Willis. He will certainly be a better emergency quarterback than CMC. As for the others, the 49ers spent the most attention to OL prospects here, and Luciano, Manning, and Fisher have a shot to contribute due to the 49ers depleted depth. Fisher and Manning both were tackles in college but will likely move inside with the 49ers, while Luciano is a center or guard. Waege may not make the roster but is a future developmental piece for Kris Korucek who can play inside or outside on the line due to his big frame.

#Team Schemes

##Offense

Kyle Shanahan's offense may be the single most beautiful offensive scheme in the NFL, and I don't say that lightly. When it's working, it's a well-oiled machine, a precision instrument that can carve up defenses and lead to players getting wide open more easily than on any other team, as well as to a running game that can feel downright unstoppable.

By now, most people know about the hallmarks of Shanahan's offense. Its best-known feature is the heavy use of the zone run, where the offensive linemen block the first man to reach a specific zone and work to reach the second level to provide gaps for the running back, who can read and react to the blocking and go where the hole is greatest. The zone run is [God's Favorite Running Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zyZx1O9pE) and has been absolutely taking over the NFL. The 49ers augment the simple zone runs with lots of complexity, using pulling and trailing linemen to get even more power to the strong side and help blockers get to the second level and eliminate linebackers, and incorporating many more pitches rather than handoffs to give the running back more room to read the blocks and hit the hole with speed.

The zone run is also augmented by the other main thing the offense is known for - motion. Tons and tons of motion - the most in the NFL. The 49ers use motion in many different ways. They'll use motion to read the defensive scheme, to deceive the defense and play off tendencies, and to get their playmakers into space with mismatches. Roughly three quarters of the 49ers offensive plays start with someone in motion.

Of course, it helps your motion when you have players who can take advantage of it. And the Niners absolutely do. The 49ers are stacked with players who are dangerous at multiple spots on the field, such as Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Kyle Jusczyk. Those four, plus Brandon Aiyuk, form what is considered the 49ers [""death lineup""](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/19/23561338/49ers-21-personnel-shanahan) - full of playmakers who can hurt you wherever they get the ball. That lineup is why the 49ers make more use of the old-fashioned 21 personnel than any other team in the league.

When it's all working, it's a beautiful offense to watch. It highlights both the individual skills of the playmakers, but also the unit of the offensive line providing key downfield blocks to spring running backs for huge holes. It specializes in getting the ball into players' hands with plenty of green grass, letting them amass huge YAC numbers and big gash plays off relatively simple concepts. And with Shanahan's ability to know his own tendencies and play off them, it's downright nightmarish to prepare for. It's no surprise that this offense is being widely copied throughout the NFL, but no team can do it like the Niners can, and it's what has allowed them to thrive without an MVP-level QB.

##Defense

Unlike the complex, beautiful machinery of the 49ers' offensive scheme, the defensive scheme is very simple. While DC Demeco Ryans now gets the fun job of turning the Texans into a winner, it seems like Steve Wilks will mostly be making [subtle changes](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/42530/steve-wilks-will-bring-subtle-tweaks-not-wholesale-changes-to-49ers-defense) to the defense that Ryans, and Robert Saleh before him, developed.

Ryans' scheme was a straightforward four-down defense that played almost exclusively in zone and rarely blitzed, preferring to get pressure from the front four. A lot of this came down to leveraging individual talent - having Nick Bosa rushing the QB while Fred Warner drops into coverage is a strong starting point. However, the defense did use some creative ways beyond the simple positional alignments to get better outcomes. For instance, like the offense, the defense featured heavy pre-snap motions and stunts, helping get their best rushers into the best matchups against the offensive line and keeping the offense guessing about both the coverage and pass rush schemes. As well, the front four often played out wide in a wide-nine front to get a big running start against the opposing QB as well as set the edge, counting on the linebackers to sort out any issues in the run game.

Wilks is a partial scheme fit - he also runs a four-man front, and he also focuses heavily on zone defenses. But in other ways, Wilks is a very different coach than Ryans. For starters, he's more of a backfield-focused coordinator, whereas Ryans (and Saleh before him) tended to focus more on the line players. To go along with that, Wilks seems to prefer to run more nickel alignment and less base than the 49ers' previous DCs. 

The biggest difference, however, is in their philosophy for bringing pressure. Ryans blitzed 22.8% of the time, 20th in the league, in 2022. Wilks blitzed 35.3% of the time, 4th in the league. The Niners, with their talented front 4, likely don't need to blitz as much as the Panthers did, and I wouldn't expect them to suddenly turn into a heavy-blitzing team. But of all the ""subtle changes"" Wilks will make, I think this is the likeliest - the Niners are going to be bringing extra men into the pass rush more often than before. Adding more blitzes can help disguise coverages with pre-snap movement and simulated blitzes can help both in disguising coverage and creating mismatches. However, there's also a chance it could open up holes in the 49ers secondary. Ultimately, it will be seen just how much the best defense in the league last year tries to get even better, or just sticks mostly with what got them there in the first place.

# Projected Starters and Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

The following table gives the position group, the projected roster with starters in bold, the PFF ranking out of all position groups (though see notes below), my personal expectation for how I think the unit will do relative to league average, whether the unit has high depth and is likely to survive injuries to the starters relatively well, and whether the unit has high variance - that is, whether I think the unit could do a lot better or a lot worse than my/PFF's prediction, or whether I think it will likely end up about where I/PFF predict (this is likelier to be low if the unit has good depth and vice versa, but not necessarily so).

*PFF ranked the secondary as one unit.

**PFF ranked QBs individually, with Purdy at 23rd. I think the unit is likely higher, since I think Lance and Darnold are better than most teams' backup QBs. (I would also have Purdy higher if healthy, but what can you do?)

***Emergency QB. Thanks, NFL.

#Schedule Predictions

The 49ers are one of the best teams in the league, and they are favored in every game but one - and I think rightfully so. Out of all of the games, I'd bet on them to win any of them but the Eagles game in week 13.

So, they'll go 16-1, right? Well, probably not - after all, if I think they have a 60% chance to win a game, I think they're favored but 40% of the time, they'll lose that game. So the best way to go about this for a team who is justifiably favored in most games is to give what I think the chances are of them winning each game, then add it all up at the end and get an expected record. I'll also give what I think are the best-case and worst-case outcomes for the year.

###Week 1: @ Pittsburgh Steelers

It's been 4 years since the Niners and Steelers faced off, and the last time these two teams played, the Steelers were still led by Captain Fat F\*\*k, Leader of Men himself, while the Niners were in the height of the Handsome Jimmy era. These two teams are very different now. Look out for the matchup of Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel vs Joey Porter Jr - and if Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to help, that will open up big plays for Kittle. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

###Week 2: @ Los Angeles Rams

**TRAP GAME ALERT!** The Kyle Shanahan-led Niners have been fairly dominant against the Sean McVay-led Rams, and there's no reason to believe that will change this year, with the Rams having considerably less hap than they have had in the past. Combine that with this barely being a road game and the Niners SHOULD win comfortably... but with a short week ahead, there's a chance they'll overlook the Rams and get surprised. Not a particularly large chance, mind you, but a chance! **Projected win: 80% likely**.

###Week 3: vs New York Giants (TNF)

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that the Giants currently have an O/U of 7.5 wins and the 49ers are currently favored by 5.5 in this one. Based on the stats, the Giants probably over-preformed last year, but they'll probably be a better team this year, with strong coaching and Daniel Jones progressing. And it's Thursday night, so anything can happen. The 49ers are a better team, and they're at home, but this could be a more challenging game than it seems. The big question - if the Niners shut down Barkley, can Jones beat them? **Projected win: 70% likely**

###Week 4: vs Arizona Cardinals

This season will be a success for the Cardinals if they get the numbers 1 and 2 picks in the draft. Apart from that, they probably will not be competing with the 49ers, especially on a long week and especially if the 49ers fall into some of the possible traps in the first few weeks and aren't looking as good as they were expected. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 5: vs Dallas Cowboys (SNF)

A major revenge game for the Cowboys, who will be looking to avenge their embarrassing playoff losses to the 49ers in two straight years. Which losses, you may ask? Why, I'm so glad you did! [Here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkzvNv2gjl0) to the 2021 Wild Card game. And [here is the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAukunmhZPM) to the 2022 Divisional Round game. Please study these videos closely. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 6: @ Cleveland Browns

I was getting so excited to root for the Browns too as a cool story whose fans deserved some success. Then they got Deshawn Watson.

Fuck Deshawn Watson.

(This should be a fairly good matchup as the Niners are well suited to stop the heavy rushing attack of Nick Chubb, but the Browns are a good team and it's a road game coming off slightly short rest, so we'll see. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.)

###Week 7: @ Minnesota Vikings (MNF)

The Vikings famously over-preformed last year, and there may be a decent regression coming this year, but they'll still be a solid team and a tough matchup on national TV in front of that crowd. The Niners will likely have the advantage of practicing somewhere in the Midwest between last week's game and this one, as they have done in the past, and they're a better team than the Vikings, but this will certainly not be an easy win. The big matchup here is Purdy (or whoever the QB is) going deep and over the middle against the soft Vikings secondary. **Projected Win: 65% likely**.

###Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals

Depending on how you feel about Dallas' chances and Dak Prescott, this is the 49ers' first or second matchup against a true Super Bowl contender and a true top-flight QB. The game is at home, which is nice, but it is on slightly shorter rest and coming back from an east coast trip (though that is easier than going the other way). The big matchups to watch - Tee Higgins vs Deommodore Lenoir, and Drake Jackson vs Orlando Brown Jr. If the Bengals can exploit the weaknesses of the 49ers defense, this will be a tough matchup to win. Whoever gets out ahead likely has a big advantage, as the Niners should be able to run the ball on the Bengals on offense. **Projected win: 55% likely**. LATE EDIT: Given Burrow's injury, he should be healthy by the time this game rolls around, but you never know with calf injuries which can have a tendency to linger. Updating to **60% likely win** based on that alone.

###Week 9: Bye

Byes in the middle of the season are always great! And after probably the hardest 4 game stretch for the team all year, it will be a much needed respite.

###Week 10: @ Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jags are expecting big things this year, especially against the weak AFC South, and they'll be a tough matchup for any team, especially on the road, and especially if Calvin Ridley returns strong. With the bye week giving the 49ers plenty of time to prepare, they should be able to slow Lawrence and the crew, especially if their pass rush can take advantage of a weaker Jacksonville offensive front - especially on the interior, with Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead going up against Ben Bartch and Luke Fortner. But if the pass rush doesn't get home, watch out for Lawrence to have a big game. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 11: vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Now that the Buccos don't have the literal GOAT playing for them, they will probably take a pretty big step back. Baker Mayfield probably isn't the answer against the 49ers defense, and I'd expect this game to look like something between what the Niners did to the Saints last year and what they did to the... well... Bucs last year. **Projected win: 85% likely**.

###Week 12: @ Seattle Seahawks (TNF)

The Niners don't get a chance at their biggest rival to win the NFC West until Week 12, and it's a perfect recipe for chaos - Thursday Night, in Seattle. Of course, that's what we said last year about Week 15 - that is, the last time the 49ers played in Seattle on Thursday Night (seriously, why do the schedulemakers do this?) - and the Niners cruised to an easy win. Brock Purdy had his way with the Seahawks twice last year, but they have a great new CB in Devon Witherspoon, not to mention Geno Smith's new toy in Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If those rookies can play up to expectations, the Seahawks will be scary. **Projected win: 60% likely**.

###Week 13: @ Philadelphia Eagles

If week 5 is a revenge game for the Cowboys, this is a super-revenge game for the Niners. In case you've been living under a rock and not on r/nfl, the Eagles beat the Niners in the NFC Championship Game last year... but with Christian McCaffrey as the 49ers QB. (Note: he does not typically play that position.) You may also have heard that the Niners players were not all too happy about how that went down and felt like they could have beaten the Eagles if Brock Purdy hadn't gotten injured. You may have even participated in discussions about whether the Niners are secretly either huge wimps or arrogant pricks for that. Please take any such comments and add them to my [suggestion box](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/350/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/9689a8f8_ecff_4195_950e_15854a7bb7b9.jpeg).

(For the record, the **correct** take on this is: The Eagles did nothing wrong and deserved to win, it's totally understandable that the Niners feel like they should have won and it's taking nothing away from the Eagles to say so, what happened isn't anyone's ""fault"" but was a normal football play that happens often in every game, and if everyone stopped asking questions about it and engaging with the responses this would all go away. Done.)

Anyway, Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the team have already said that they've circled this game in the calendar, but let's just evaluate it as a football game. The Eagles are a very good football team and likely remain so, even if one of their best players last season will now be trying to sack Jalen Hurts instead. These two teams are likely the favorites in the NFC and for good reason. The Eagles, as presently constructed, have very few weaknesses, but the linebacker core looks much depleted after their starters both left in free agency. The Niners have to like the matchup of George Kittle and Christian McCaffery over the middle against Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow. But against a team this stacked, on the road, it's hardly a surprise that this is the one game of the year that the 49ers are disfavored in, especially with the Eagles' monster D-line going against the 49ers O-line. **Projected win: 40% likely**.

###Week 14: vs Seattle Seahawks

A much more normal game against the Seahawks, on normal rest and at home. If the Niners win in Philly, this may turn into a trap game with the high emotions of that game. If they lose, they could be extra motivated. This game will likely have implications for the division, though, so the 49ers should be able to get motivated regardless. **Projected win: 75% likely**.

###Week 15: @ Arizona Cardinals

See Week 4 above. There really isn't much to see here, especially if the Cardinals are in full tank mode. **Projected win: 95% likely**.

###Week 16: vs Baltimore Ravens (MNF, on Christmas Day)

Another big, dramatic, nationally televised game against a strong team, this game may well be one of the most viewed regular season games this year. The key matchup here is strength against strength. Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews is a test for any linebacker core, as you have to both mark Jackson and prevent him from escaping for big plays on the ground but also match up with Andrews closely. If any team can handle this matchup, though, it's the Niners, with Greenlaw likely being slated to shadow Jackson and Warner to take the primary responsibility against Andrews in shorter routes. The Niners will try to make Odell Beckham Jr, Zay Flowers, and Rashod Bateman beat them, and Flowers might be the x-factor. **Projected win: 65% likely**.

###Week 17: @ Washington Commanders

**MEGA TRAP GAME ALERT!** You'd expect the Niners to easily handle the Commies, but this is as close as you can get to a scheduled loss in the NFL. The 49ers face a tough team in week 16 on Monday Night, at the end of a brutal 5 game stretch, then have to travel across the country for a 10:00AM Pacific start time against a team that may well be fighting for their playoff lives. If the 49ers have comfortably sewn up the division here, they might have issues getting up for this game - even if there's something to play for, this is going to be a tough game, especially if Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen take advantage of the 49ers OL. **Projected Win: 55% likely** (and that's probably being generous).

###Week 18: vs Los Angeles Rams

This game all depends on whether the 49ers have anything to play for. If they have a reason to care about this game, they should roll. Otherwise, expect whoever the backup QB is to get the start and most of the other starters to leave early - so, in other words, still a decent chance for a win against the Rams. **Projected Win: 75% likely**.

##49ers Projected Record: **12-5** (11.80-5.20)

Given that Vegas currently has their O/U at 11.5, it feels about right. The 49ers have a very good chance of winning their division based on that record, and it's fair to say that anything short of making the playoffs would be a huge disappointment. That said, I think there's a pretty high amount of variance for this team as a whole, and they could over-preform or under-perform that record pretty drastically.

What is the best case, somewhat realistic scenario for this team? It involves either Purdy or Lance - or maybe even Darnold - turning into a top-10 level QB (unlikely but possible - Purdy's stats were pretty much there) and all of their starters staying largely healthy (probably less likely). In that scenario, this team absolutely has the talent to run the table, or at least become the first team to finish 19-1. Is it likely? Not at all. A more realistic but still optimistic scenario has them finishing around 14-3 and snagging the bye en route to bringing home Lombardi number 6.

Of course, there's absolutely a worst-case scenario for the team as well, which involves none of the QBs putting up even decent play and a 2020-like season full of injuries, where the 49ers weak depth gets exposed. If they truly get ruined by injuries, this team could finish as low as 6-11 or 5-12, and a more realistic but pessimistic scenario sees them finish around .500 and missing the playoffs.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15gkvos,0.94,False,1691012593.0

500,"NFL considers alternatives to the kickoff, including the XFL model",nfl,"&gt;In the XFL, the kick happens at the 30 yard line. Other than the kicker, the players on the kicking team are aligned at the receiving team’s 35 yard line. Ten of the receiving team’s players are positioned five yards away. Only the kicker and the returner may move before the ball is touched by the player fielding the kick.

&gt;The NFL is exploring XFL data regarding the play. The overriding goal is to reduce the potential for concussions (serious neck injuries are a less-publicized concern) by shrinking the distance between opposing players. The XFL rule leaves only five yards of space for players to cover before contact, keeping them from getting to top speed.

&gt;Switching to the XFL approach wouldn’t be an easy sell. One source with extensive knowledge and experience coaching special teams predicts it will be an “ugly play,” with the kick returner getting “crushed.”

Deshaun's 2022 doesn't meet any qualifiers. It wasn't a good season but he also had rust i'm sure.

Now it is fair to say that there have been some new blood with QBs. Allen was not good until 2020. Burrow and Herbert and Hurts became well known post 2020. 

So here is where Watson would rank in these categories for last season. This is meant to show where Watson stacks up to CURRENT guys if he returned to each level of play in his career

|If Watson played at (year) level in 2022|EPA|DVOA|QBR|PFF|

|2020|.22 (3rd)|20.2% (4th)|70.5 (3rd)|92.5 (3rd)|

This isn't including Watson's rushing value that some guys don't have. 

If Watson returns to his previous level of play, he will be a top 5 QB in the AFC. Now this is dependent on if other guys make a leap, but that is how it stands right now",t5_2qmg3,t3_15gcs1y,0.37,False,1690992097.0

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

# [Recapping 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqpna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Coming off the stink of what can only be called a disappointing end to the Mike Zimmer regime, the influx of young blood into the organization was refreshing. New GM-HC pair Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and Kevin O'Connell spent a capital on defense, adding Za'Darius Smith, Harrison Phillips, and Jordan Hicks in free agency before spending 5 of their first 6 draft picks on defenders.

What followed was the most titillating 13-win season the league has ever seen. Nobody could figure out if the Vikings were a good team. Even Kirk Cousins himself said that early in the season, the team was trying to figure out if they were going to have to hunker down for a hard year or if they were going to be a threat.

But throughout the season, O'Connell reiterated that these wins did not come via luck (even if they were the [5th luckiest team last year](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2023/1/13/23552871/minnesota-vikings-have-been-lucky-are-they-good-wild-card-round)). He spoke again and again about how crucial it was that the team perform in key situations. When it was time to make a play, the team made a play. But ideally, you want to win at least a couple of games by more than one score. You want your team to be in a position where you don't have to make a 4th quarter comeback.

It is with an understanding of the nuanced position of the 2022 Vikings that Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell approached the 2023 season with a ""competitive rebuild"" in mind. The team is capable of winning in key situations, but the team needs to be capable to putting together and executing a strong gameplan. The talent at several positions on the team was weak. And with a full year of Kirk Cousins under O'Connell's watch, the team comes closer and closer in the search for what the QB position looks like after.

# [Brian Flores](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhqqx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In 2022, Ed Donatell led the Vikings to one of the worst, blandest, most predictable defenses the league has ever seen. He was brought in to implement the Vic Fangio system that had seen success with the Rams, Broncos, and Bears, but Donatell's playcalling made the scheme look like the corpse of what Fangio was doing in Chicago and Denver.

The Vikings finished 31st in yards allowed per game, 30th in net passing yards allowed per attempt, last in passing first downs allowed per game, and 25th in defensive EPA/play. The team had its worst defensive DVOA since Leslie Frazier was HC. In the playoff loss to the Giants, the Vikings gave up 23 plays of 10+ yards. No other team gave up more than 18 in the playoffs.

Enter: Brian Flores.

In terms of defensive scheme, there is nobody the Vikings could have brought in that would have been a larger shift from the previous iteration of the defense than Flores. Gone is the soft zone coverage that let offenses carve up the middle of the field. In its place: an amoebic aggressive scheme that isn't afraid to strike out trying to hit a home run.

# [Scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/15gboqo/comment/juhset1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Year 1 under Kevin O'Connell was a breath of fresh air compared to what life had been like with Mike Zimmer's carousel of OCs that much too closely resembled the professorship of the Defense of the Dark Arts classroom. In last year's [Offseason Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/vy4ksj/comment/ifzw2gx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about how O'Connell's Rams were not the pass-happy offense they had been portrayed as, but instead merely looked pass happy because of how they employed their skill position players. That is, the deployment of 11 personnel (and Cooper Kupp's use as a proxy TE) made the offense more multiple and more able to quickly threaten an aggressive deep pass.

Where the O'Connell distinguished himself from his previous employer was in how he adapted the scheme to his personnel. Cousins thrives in play action. Another large shift in O'Connell's philosophy was the involvement of the TEs, especially after the Hockenson acquisition. CJ Ham also got usage in the scheme as opposed to O'Connell's previous employer which didn't even carry a FB on the roster.

Today's NFL offenses are largely split into two categories: Shanahan Scheme and Everyone Else. And on the Shanahan Scheme side lies a spectrum. On one end is Kyle Shanahan's dream offense. And on the other end is Sean McVay.

O'Connell began his Vikings' tenure closer to the McVay end of the spectrum. But over the course of the year he slowly shifted closer to a Shanahan-style scheme. With the addition Josh Oliver, O'Connell has even more loudly proclaimed his desire to shift to more heavy personnel as his base package. We'll see how this shift goes, as the team is also witnessing turnover at RB and WR while keeping constant a shaky offensive line. But the path here is clear: build in the presence of a run threat to allow Minnesota's star WR talent to shine.

531,"The only quarterbacks ranked ahead of Kirk Cousins for the NFL Top 100 from the 2022-2023 season are Herbert, Allen, Hurts, Burrow, and Mahomes. Is that a fair ranking?",nfl,"Reminder that the top 100 is based off of a poll of NFL players voting on their peers *based on the most recent NFL season.* This is not a ranking of the best players going into the next season. This is not a power ranking of best players to have going forward. The top 100 is purely based on the performance of the previous year. 

Cousins threw for 4,500 yards, 31 total touchdowns, and 17 total turnovers on 66% completion percentage this season, although many of his advanced stats took a hit (yards/attempt, QBR, and passer rating were all the lowest of his career as a Viking). 

The Vikings wildly overachieved last season, and a huge part of that was Kirk and the passing offense. Last season, the Vikings had:

* the 31st ranked defense by yards allowed.
* the 30th ranked defense by points allowed. 
* the 27th ranked rushing offense. 

Yet, they won 13 games with an unexpected NFCN division championship and the 8th best total offense in football. Perhaps the most saliently, Kirk also tied the all-time record for most 4th quarter comebacks in a season. Kirk's increased aggressiveness in the passing game and his ability to operate in clutch moments-- ironically two of his most commonly cited flaws through most of his career-- played an outsized role in how successful the Vikings' season was. 

I think, again talking purely about last season, saying Kirk was a top 6-8 QB is a fair ranking. The only other guys not on the aforementioned list I think you could make arguments for being better than Kirk were Jared Goff and Geno Smith.

|PFF|91.7 (2nd)|90.7 (3rd)|
|CPOE|**6.7 (1st)**|2.7 (4th)|

The numbers indicate Joe is a very good QB! But they do not back up top 2 or top 3 QB AT ALL

And now I will tackle this idea that ""Burrow elevates for the playoffs""

PLAYOFF Games

|2021 Raiders (Wild Card)|.278 (4th for WC weekend)|
|:-|:-|


Joe played very well in the Raiders game. No argument there

|2021 Titans (Divisional)|\-.085|
|:-|:-|


Burrow ""led"" the Bengals to only 19 points, despite his defense getting 3 INTs on Tannehill. Even his game winning drive was 1 throw for 16 yards and then a kneel down. He contributed very little offensively. 0 TD passes

|2021 Chiefs (Conference)|.168|
|:-|:-|


Joe held it together here. He made some nice evasions of Jones, so I do give him credit for this. It was not a wow performance but he did what he needed to do. He passes

|2021 Rams (Super Bowl)|\-.141|
|:-|:-|


Joe was AWFUL vs the Rams. The one TD he threw was a clear facemask on the Bengals WRs. Burrow and the offense went 3 and out 5 times in the 2nd half. They gained 62 yards on 31 plays on their final 6 drives.

Burrow had 2nd and 1 from the 50 yard line with 55 seconds left and they didn't get it. It is one of the 3 worst super bowls by EPA/play in NFL history (since 1999)

NEW SEASON

|2022 Ravens (Wild Card)|.090 (7th for WC)|
|:-|:-|


Burrow was average at best vs the Ravens. Yes they had a nasty defense but 17 points on offense isn't going to get it done. The Bengals were on their way to losing before Huntley fumbled the sneak.

Burrow actually had a worse EPA/Play than Justin Herbert in the Jaguars Chargers 27 point choke. And Herbert got flamed for it.

|2022 Bills (Divisional)|.389|
|:-|:-|


FINALLY, an elite performance in the playoffs from Burrow. Burrow came out and immediately lead 2 great TD drives. He was very good and gave the Bills no chance. A+ from me here.

|2022 Chiefs (Conference|.008|
|:-|:-|


An then Joe followed it up with a very average to downright bad performance vs the Chiefs. He threw 2 INTs, had 0 net yards passing in the 1st quarter. And with the chance to drive for a game winning field goal, he took another bad sack. The Bengals defense played well enough to win. The offense and the QB didn't

**Conclusion:** Joe Burrow is a franchise QB. I don't argue this. He is even very good. But he is not an ""elite QB"". An elite QB has the stats to back it up. Burrow is 6-10th in most stats. He is no Mahomes, as much as the media wants you to think otherwise",t5_2qmg3,t3_15fnzki,0.36,False,1690922122.0

586,Quarterback Evaluations,nfl,"Whenever I see these off-season tier lists I get really confused and I am curious to hear how this sub perceives various quarterbacks and elements of their game.

For example, I am a Vikings fan. 

I think Kirk is a solid QB, but then I hear people compare Kirk to Dak or put them on the same level and I just don’t get it.

Dak is a complete player, he is above average to good in the play/pass game, the drop back game and as a runner.

Kirk on the other hand is elite in the play/pass game but gives you next to nothing in the drop back game or as a runner.

When looking at it that way how could you compare them as being on a similar level?

So I am curious, when you are considering where a QB stacks up, what are you considering to be important? 

Are you looking at what the QBs skill set allows your offense to do (like the Dak/Kirk example I gave). Or are you looking at how well they do what they are asked to?",t5_2qmg3,t3_15flfql,0.37,False,1690916384.0

**Guidelines:**

1. Try to make original jokes. We've all seen the played out jokes and memes (examples:28-3,one yard short, russ throwing on the one yard line), let's get some new material in here. Find a new slant. 

2. Don't waste your good jokes about another team until it's their turn to be roasted. 

3. Jokes are jokes. Laugh, head over to the burn center, and move on. Let's not get into heated arguements in these threads, they are just for fun. 

4. Don't troll and/or attack the users posting jokes.

5. Teams were chosen in a random order. You'll find out the next team to be roasted in the current thread. This will give you a day to craft your jokes. 

6. HAVE FUN! When all 32 teams have been roasted, we'll be just a few days away from regular season football. That being said,fire away!

**Tomorrow's Team:New Orleans Saints**

The non-active streaks were the Chargers between 1987 to 1993 (Dan Fouts/Babe Laufenberg/Jim McMahon/Mark Vlasic/John Friesz/Bob Gagliano/Stan Humphries) and the Browns from 2013 to 2019 (listed below). 

The actives ones: 

The Colts

1. 2017 - Scott Tolzien (Benched after the opener, never played in a NFL game again)

2. 2018 - Andrew Luck (Retired after this season)

3. 2019 - Jacoby Brissett (Slap my salami, he’s now a Commie - with the Commanders)

4. 2020 - Philip Rivers (Retired after this season)

5. 2021 - Carson Wentz (Currently a free agent)

6. 2022 - Matt Ryan (Signed with CBS Sports)

7. 2023 - Most likely Anthony Richardson or Gardner Minshew

The Commanders

1. 2017 - Kirk Cousins (Signed with Vikings after this season)

2. 2018 - Alex Smith (Suffered horrible leg injuries in Week 11)

3. 2019 - Case Keenum (Now with the Texans)

4. 2020 - Dwayne Haskins (RIP)

5. 2021 - Ryan Fitzpatrick (Was injured in the first game after 6 passes and then retired at the end of the season)

6. 2022 - Carson Wentz (Currently a free agent)

7. 2023 - Most likely Sam Howell or Jacoby Brissett

2. 2008 - Derek Anderson

3. 2009 - Brady Quinn

4. 2010 - Jake Delhomme

5. 2011 - Colt McCoy

679,Kids these days don't know how great of an era is ending,nfl,"With moves from Rodgers and Carr, only two qb's remain in a tenure longer than five years: Prescott (7) and Mahomes (6).   Between 1998-2017, arguably only ONE team never had a qb for a five year span in that period:

BUF: 4 with Fitzmagic

WAS: technically passes, but Cousins sat behind RGIII for a good bit of it.

DEN:  Arguably passes with Griese, also 4 with Plummer, Peyton, and Osweiler

&amp;#x200B;

2009 was perhaps the peak of the era, as two thirds of the league had a starting qb in a stint that would last five years or more.  2018 arguably competes in this stat as a lot of old heads were still playing by then, but it was clearly a start of a new qb era. But for '09 (years listed for 10 or more seasons as starter with team):

Brady (19 with NE)

Big Ben (17)

Carson Palmer

Flacco (11 with BAL)

Vince Young

Peyton (13 with IND)

Not necessarily saying this was the best era of qbs of all time, but this era had an INSANE sense of team and franchise permanency that's unheard of today. Absolute great time to be an nfl fan. I imagine we will see a similar level of permanence around 2030, as this new crop of qb's hit their golden years.

I do think it's fair to consider this a turning point in the nfl, as the peak franchise passer changed the game in terms of passing output. Now we are beginning the era of the running qb in addition to all that, and the further death of the bell cow running back.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15enqnb,0.56,False,1690827616.0

696,"Looking back, Should the Colts have kept Peyton Manning and built a team around him instead of drafting Andrew Luck?",nfl,"The argument for both sides of this discussion can definitely be had, I personally have always been under the side of keeping Peyton Manning even with his injury issues. I am not a Colts fan but a Texans fan and damn I wanted Peyton Manning so bad when he was a free agent. Regardless He went to the Broncos and went to two superbowls while winning one. The last one wasn’t off his back but regardless he had some pretty nice seasons in Denver. I think he definitely could have had the same type of success if not more had the Colts kept him. 
Now Andrew Luck is no slouch and probably did as best as a QB could have with the expectations he had since day one. He never had a solid O-Line so maybe Peyton Manning wouldn’t have lasted as long with the Colts as he did with the Broncos. Luck was definitely sensational when he played! He turned the 2-14 Colts around in a season! He definitely was worth taking the mantle from Peyton. He was very injury prone though although I definitely blame a good chunk of his injury issues on the Colts. As many times as he got them to the playoffs he never got them to a Superbowl where Peyton Manning got them there twice, once if you discount the 2nd one and regardless of the giant age gap, they only retired 3 years apart from eachother.

711,NFL Recap: 07/24/2023 - 07/30/2023: Lots of NFL News!!!,nfl,"**Layout:**

— Individual Team News + Stone’s Cold Takes

— Miscellaneous/Other NFL News

— Featured Team of the Week (Product + Restaurant) - Dallas Cowboys

&amp;#x200B;

**Arizona Cardinals:**

* HC Jonathan Gannon has set a new tone with the team
* QB Kyler Murray has no timetable for return
* S Budda Baker is all in after settling contract issue
* Signed Pat Elflein and Geoff Swaim

Overall it sounds like things are good with the team. HC Jonathan Gannon has zero tolerance for fights and has set his tone and made sure that is a part of it since coming here. We are back to folks saying it is day to day with QB Kyler Murray and it will be interested to watch and see how he progresses in his injury recovery. Huge win for the team that S Budda Baker after working through his contract issues is all in for the team. He is such a key piece for the team and will help them maintain a leader on the defensive side of the ball.

**Atlanta Falcons:**

* Signed RB Godwin Igwebuike
* Overall QB Desmond Ridder has looked good thus far at camp
* Rookie RB BJ Robinson impressing early in camp
* WR Mack Hollins has added muscle and showed out so far
* Eddie Goldman is considering retirement again
* Agreed to terms with DT Justin Ellis
* Waived RB Caleb Huntley
* TE Mycole Pruitt re-signed

It appears things are going to be good hear in Atlanta. The team welcomed the largest crowd by far that they have had in the last few years to watch training camp. Good to see QB Ridder getting his footing and early and contributions some expected names are making such Mack Hollins. It appears this team is going to have plenty of depth and a much more dynamic offensive identity.

**Baltimore Ravens:**

* Re-signed CB Trayvon Mullen and place on non-football injury list
* QB Lamar Jackson turned down being on season 2 of the show Quarterback
* QB Lamar Jackson and WR OBJ building chemistry early
* Todd Monken feels QB Lamar Jackson will call plays better without wristband
* WR Zay Flowers has showcased his shiftiness
* Claimed WR Makai Polk off waivers
* Signed RB Melvin Gordon
* Could have interest in EDGE Chase Young
* Agreed to terms with Nick Moore

Overall it appears that things are going well for the team thus far this offseason. After the Lamar drama there has not been too much drama. They were able to sign Melvin Gordon to add some running back depth and apparently still have interest in acquiring Chase Young. They appear to be adding the right pieces to be a very difficult team to beat this year. It will be interesting to watch how QB Lamar Jackson does this year without a wristband as well as something that OC Todd Monken is pushing him to do.

**Buffalo Bills:**

* TE Kincaid has impressed thus far early on
* RB James Cook has been making plays and team is working to get him involved
* Connection between QB Allen and WR Diggs looking strong thus far
* WR Diggs addressed the media at length and cleared the air on earlier offseason confusion
* Kim Pegula attends first practice since 2022 cardiac arrest
* Signed Kyron Brown and waived/injured Cam Dantzler
* Released WR Jalen Wayne
* WR Trent Sherfield has been standing out in practice
* Signed WR Andy Isabella and released WR Jalen Wayne
* Worked out WR N’Keal Harry
* CB Damar Hamlin is full-go at practice
* Signed RB Darrynton Evans

All is well with the Bills. QB Josh Allen is looking crisp overall and has been working well with a variety of different targets. WR Gabe Davis looks healthy and had a good week besides one end zone drill where he and Allen stayed after to work on it. Also, itw as a good move by WR Stefon Diggs to take the time to address the media and clear the air following his comments made earlier in the offseason about the team. I think that all the attention not being on them and some of that getting sucked up by the Jets may help this team play looser this year.

**Carolina Panthers:**

* CB CJ Henderson sees this as a big year for him after team declined 5th-year option
* QB Bryce Young has had his moments where he has wowed teammates
* HC Frank Reich confirmed that QB Bryce Young is the team’s starter

It is official the #1 pick Bryce Young is the starting QB for the Panthers. Overall he has had his struggles with his fair share of highlights in camp thus far that have wowed teammates like just about any rookie. What is key here for Young is that he takes full advantage of the coaching staff he has and how QB friendly they appear to be.

**Chicago Bears:**

* QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore have built a lot of chemistry thus far
* OT Darnell Wright accidentally trained for the WR conditioning test
* WR Velus Jones Jr. has shown significant improvement
* WR Chase Claypool understands the importance of this year
* Have interest in signing DE Justin Houston
* TE Cole Kmet signed 4-year $50m extension
* Reports say QB Justin Fields has been shredding the defense
* Signed Isaiah Ford and Buddy Johnson

Vibes are high at camp here and it seems the media is doing a lot to try and hype them up. They signed TE Cole Kmet to a 4-year extension and may have interest in DE Justin Houston or some other pass rusher. QB Justin Fields and WR DJ Moore have established a lot of chemistry early and have looked good in practice thus far. Some funny news is that OT Darnell Wright accidentally prepped for the WR conditioning test so when it came time to do his conditioning test it was actually relatively easy. Maybe it is something that will be implemented as a standard to help folks make sure they are in shape.

**Cincinnati Bengals:**

* QB Joe Burrow out several weeks with calf strain
   * Signed QB Reid Sinnett
* DE Trey Hendrickson signed a 1-year extension with $21m in new money

Best news possible following the QB Joe Burrow injury is that it is a just a calf strain and it sounds like he will miss several weeks but still has a chance to start the season on the field. This could have been a lot worse and scared a lot of folks. DE Trey Hendrickson has been a difference maker on defense the past few years and getting a 1-year extension done is a great move. Now the question still remain about what QB Joe Burrow’s contract will look like and should happen any day now.

**Cleveland Browns:**

* HC Kevin Stefanski makes team run sprints after fights
* QB Deshaun Watson has been tearing it up at camp

Sounds like HC Kevin Stefanski knows how to punish guys because I definitely am not a fan of running and it doesn’t appear that anyone really is because it is always the first choice for a punishment when mistakes are made. In this instance it is dealing with team fights that folks across the league have been dealing with. On another note it sounds like QB Deshaun Watson is benefiting from not having the legal troubles to deal with that he did last year and is starting practice strong.

**Dallas Cowboys:**

* CB Trevon Diggs missed practice time with bruised toe
* Owner Jerry Jones says that Zach Martin deal is still outstanding because have to save money to pay Micah Parsons
* Signed CB Trevon Diggs to a 5-year $97m extension
* RB Deuce Vaughn is looking shifty and quick in camp
* QB Dak Prescott turned down season 2 of the Quarterback show
* WR CeeDee Lamb is not worried about his contract and letting agent handle it
* S Donovan Wilson is expected to be out 4-6 weeks

There is a lot going on here. First off, good to see they got a deal done with CB Trevon Diggs and have him locked up for quite some time now. The concern comes with the fact that they haven’t gotten a deal done with WR Lamb yet and have their top offensive lineman holding out and not practicing with the team. It sounds like they have a lot to get worked out before they have to pay Micah Parsons next year who may be making a deal difficult for some of his teammates. It seems like this isn’t a great thing to say from owner Jerry Jones and some of these owners need to be a little more careful with how they deal with the media. More on this later when we get to the Colts. Other than contract stuff S Donovan Wilson is out 4-6 weeks and RB Deuce Vaughn has looked really impressive thus far and is looking to be a Darren Sproles type contributor.

**Denver Broncos:**

* HC Sean Payton called out former HC Nathaniel Hackett and the Jets as a whole
   * Went back on comments and said they were a mistake
* Signed K Brett Maher

Not too much news here other than the surprising comments/attack that Sean Payton directed towards former Broncos HC Nathaniel Hackett and the Jets as a whole. Payton claims it was a mistake and he forgot to “take off” his sport commentator/analyst camp. Either way he said what he said and we can look forward to an exciting game that will take place on October 8th.

**Detroit Lions:**

* OT Penei Sewell is in concussion protocol
* WR Jameson Williams has been very impressive in his short amount of practice thus far
* CB CJ Gardner Johnson back at practice after injury scare
* WR Denzel Mims enjoying the change of scenery

Some troubling news that Penei Sewell is in concussion protocol but it is early enough that he should recover long before the season begins. I bet Lions fans are still wishing that WR Jameson Williams was able to start the season on the field but they will have to wait to see what a lot his teammates are calling the best young receiver in the league. He only had 1 catch this year so he has nowhere to go but up.

**Green Bay Packers:**

* Released Jonathan Garvin
* QB Jordan Love got reached out to by QB Aaron Rodgers offering words of encouragement
* HC Matt LaFleur says that QB Jordan Love has total command of the offense
* QB Jacob Eason worked out for the team

The media has not been super loud about the Packers which I see as a good sign because if QB Jordan Love was struggling it would be all over the news cycles because it attaches to QB Aaron Rodgers and all else that goes on in New York. Since he is not in the media that much and reports have been good it is likely very good news for Packers fans that they have another franchise quarterback. Obviously it is too early to tell but I would not be surprised if things work out very well for the team.

**Houston Texans:**

* Team views QB CJ Stroud as the starting QB
   * Stroud and Mills still each taking 1st team reps at practice
* WR John Metchie looking good in practice just a year after the cancer diagnosis
* WR Tank Dell has impressed lots of folks early
* Will Anderson has impressed thus far in camp with Von Miller-like abilities
* Waived WR Amari Rodgers
* Activated veterans DT Sheldon Rankins and CB Kendall Sheffield
* Signed Tackle George Fant
* RT Tytus Howard signed 3-year $56m extension

While the team views QB Stroud as the #1 guy it sounds like the coaching staff is not quite as convinced yet and still has both taking first team reps and have decided not to name a starter just yet. The young WRs are looking good and that is important given that other options are pretty limited at the position and the early reports of Will Anderson have been good. The team signed RT Tytus Howard to a 3-year $56m extension which I am sure both rookie QBs are happy about and a good move by the team to get that done. The Texans are another team that has done a good job of avoiding too many distractions and not getting too much media attention despite having 2 of the top 3 picks in the draft with them in training camp.

**Indianapolis Colts:**

* RB Jonathan Taylor requested a trade after Jim Irsay’s comments
   * The two sides have been meeting this past week
* QB Anthony Richardson working with 1s and impressing early
   * Looked really good on medium to deep throws and struggled a bit on short ones
* Signed Isaac Taylor-Stuart and waived Cole Coleman
* Placed DE Tyquan Lewis, TE Will Mallory, and RB Jonathan Taylor on the PUP list
* Team oddly might move RB Jonathan Taylor from PUP to the NFI claiming a back injury even though he has never mentioned one

Ohh my….right when things are starting to look good for this organization they come tumbling down. It is almost like there is an Andrew Luck curse or something for the team not doing a good job of protecting him during his time. Owner Jim Irsay ran his mouth and frustrated RB Jonathan Taylor and now it has made an already unsure situation extremely tense. This seems like it is going to be a difficult one to resolve at this point because neither side appears to want to budge and there is unlikely to be a good trade partner who would be willing to give up much.

**Jacksonville Jaguars:**

* RB Travis Etienne looking quick thus far
* WR Calvin Ridley looking good in camp and working to get reputation and name back

Not too much news out of the Jaguars but WR Ridley is looking good and like the WR1 he was before his suspension. RB Travis Etienne is looking healthy and strong. If he can be healthy then I think it will go a long way for QB Lawrence who will have a safety blanket in difficult situations.

**Kansas City Chiefs:**

* WR Justyn Ross continues to impress at training camp
* TE Travis Kelce got into a skirmish and talks to stepping up as a leader
   * HC Andy Reid commented as welling saying there is no place for fighting and met with TE Travis Kelce to address his fighting issues
* WR Marques Valdes-Scantling has been taking on leadership role among WRs
* Signed Ty Scott
* WR John Ross retired

First off, it sounds like the Chiefs are going to do a lot with the WRs and targets they have in the building. QB Mahomes makes that possible and has been working well with all the young and inexperienced talent at the WR position the team has. In other news TE Travis Kelce has been having fighting issues that appear to be very one sided as him being the aggressor and the main punch thrower. I know teammates chirp and do things to bother each other in these practices but like folks have said already fighting is not okay and there is no excuse. The videos released don’t make Kelce look all that good and as a leader on the team like others have said he needs to be above that. He is the best TE in the league so people are going to be consistently coming at him both in practice and during the regular season. He has not been known to have this issue so it should be something that gets cleared up but definitely something that needed to addressed and taken care of early so that it doesn’t result in other issues down the road.

**Las Vegas Raiders:**

* WR Hunter Renfrow feels he let his teammates down last year
* Rumors WR Davante Adams may not be happy…likely false
* Tom Brady’s ownership stake could be in jeopardy after new ownership laws put in place
* Brought back DL Kyle Peko
* Signed Isaac Rochell

Interesting how quickly rumors about WR Davante Adams was unhappy came out. Later it came out that those were false rumors but it felt like the media was almost trying to get WR Adams to feel that way and push him towards New York. Interesting to hear WR Hunter Renfrow come out and say he feels like he lets his teammates down last year since recently rumors have come out that he might be fighting for his spot to make the team and could be released.

**Los Angeles Chargers:**

* Signed Blake Lynch
* QB Justin Herbert and WR Quentin Johnston connecting on deep balls
* Signed WR Milton Wright
* Signed QB Justin Herbert to a $262.5m contract w/ $133.7m guaranteed

The Chargers have their franchise quarterback and hopefully they can take better advantage of this one than they did the last one. The Chargers have scored more point than any other team since Herbert but also have allowed the most point of any team so clearly that is not the best winning formula. It appears though on offense they won’t stop putting up a lot of points with rookie WR Quentin Johnston showing out thus far. We shall see if the defense can stay healthy and step up this year.

**Los Angeles Rams:**

* Signed RB Royce Freeman
* RB Sony Michel retired after just signing with the team a month ago
* WRs DeMarcus Robinson and Tyler Johnson off to a great start in WR3 battle
* QB Stetson Bennett and WR Puka Nacua impressing early in camp
* DL Aaron Donald still feels he has something to prove
* WR Cooper Kupp finding his groove again
* QB Matt Stafford and WR Van Jefferson got a ton of work in this offseason

Surprise retirement from RB Sony Michel a month after signing with the team. Other than that things appear to be going well but it really doesn’t feel or seem like the team has anywhere near the same excitement and talent as they did just 2 years ago when they won the Super Bowl. This will be an interesting team to watch going forward and just how things end up panning out.

**Miami Dolphins:**

* Activated Isaiah Wynn
* QB Tua Tagavailoa feeling healthier and more confident than ever
   * Turned down the Quarterback show
* Signed CB Eli Apple to a 1-year deal
   * CB Eli Apple and WR Tyreek Hill appear to have squashed their beef
* CB Jalen Ramsey had surgery on his meniscus and is likely out til December
* WR Tyreek Hill reached settlement

Tough news this week with CB Jalen Ramsey having meniscus surgery for a fully torn mensicus and being out til December most likely so who do they bring in. CB Eli Apple who had been known to have beef with WR Tyreek Hill. Appears all is good now and WR Hill probably thankful something else about him was talked about in the media other than his recent legal troubles.

**Minnesota Vikings:**

* Signed Danielle Hunter to a 1-year $20m deal with $17m guaranteed
* WR Justin Jefferson has not lost a step and is making incredible plays early and often
* WR Jordan Addison making plays early

Not too much news overall besides the team doing a good job and getting a deal done with Danielle Hunter to a 1-year deal. He will definitely be a good guy to have around to help continue to lead the defense after an offseason of changes on that side of the ball.

**New England Patriots:**

* HC Bill Belichick raved about WR Kendrick Bourne and the impact he has
* WR Demario Douglas has impressed thus far
* Hosted RB Ezekiel Elliott for a visit
* Team and EDGE Matthew Judon have had open dialogue about contract
* CB Christian Gonzalez has been impressive from the start
* DL Christian Barmore excused from camp for birth of his child
* Signed WR Jalen Hurd

Overall it has sounded like defense and offense have been very evenly matched thus far but that QB Mac Jones has looked the best thus far of the QBs. Good to see him taking charge and taking back his spot. Sounds like RB Ezekiel Elliott had a good visit and remain in contact with the team. This should be an exciting year for the Patriots!

**New Orleans Saints:**

* DE Jabari Zenga retired
* Signed Long Snapper Zach Wood to a record breaking 4-year contract extension worth over $5.3m and $2.3m guaranteed
* Signed TE Jimmy Graham to a 1-year deal
* Signed G Max Garcia

Yes, you read that right TE Jimmy Graham signed with the Saints to play not to coach or just have a retirement ceremony. This one definitely came as a surprise but it sure seems like he has stayed in pretty good shape and maybe the time away gave him the time he needed to heal. Other than that they have the richest long snapper after signing him to a record breaking deal.

**New York Giants:**

* WR Darius Slayton practiced with tennis balls to improve his hands
* TE Darren Waller has been turning heads at practice thus far and is ungaurdable
* WR Jalin Hyatt is impressing a lot of folks and already working with the 1s
* RT Evan Neal lost 10-15 pounds while adding muscle
* Activated WRs Sterling Shepard and Jamison Crowder
* Signed LT Andrew Thomas to a 5-year $117.5m extension with $67m guaranteed
* Signed RB Saquon Barkley to an adjusted 1-year franchise tag worth $11m
* Signed DL Tashawn Bower

Big news here was after the long drama between Barkley and the team he ended up signing an adjusted franchise tag that nets him about another million dollars. Other than that though TE Darren Waller has been unguardable basically in practice and WR Jalin Hyatt has been working in with the 1s. Also, the team locked up LT Andrew Thomas with a 5-year $117.5m extension. They are doing all right things to set QB Daniel Jones up for a ton of success this year. If he is not able to put it together this year there are going to be a lot of offseason questions. All early signs though make it sound like the Giants have been making all the right moves.

**New York Jets:**

* QB Aaron Rodgers fired back at HC Sean Payton in an on-field interview
   * Took a $35m paycut and now contract is a 2-year $75m guaranteed contract
* OT Duane Brown is progressing well but has no timetable on return
* RB Dalvin Cook visited the team and they are the favorite to sign him
   * QB Aaron Rodgers talked to him before drills at camp
* QB Zach Wilson and OT Mekhi Bekton to play in HOF game
   * Will not play starters overall in this game
* WR Garrett Wilson has looked really good but suffered a low ankle sprain
* RB Breece Hall expected back in a couple of weeks
* Activated WR Randall Cobb
* WR Jason Brownlee has been impressive thus far

Wow, the media does not rest with this Jets team. It seems like every little thing that happens is headline news here. RB Dalvin Cook appears to have a strong preference to sign with the team if they can get a good enough deal on the table. That should be possible after QB Aaron Rodgers took his paycut. I know the paycut is a lot but the amount of money Rodgers stands to make being with NY media probably greatly outweighs what he gave up in his contract. It has been all good news from the team thus far though besides a few bumps and bruises with some guys. Will be exciting to see some of the backups in the HOF game Thursday.

**Philadelphia Eagles:**

* Potentially in the market to add a safety
* CB Darius Slay and coach Matt Patricia had a man-to-man conversation about issues back in Detroit but all is in the past now and they settled their differences
* WR Quez Watkins has been impressing a lot early in camp
* Bringing back the “Kelly Green” uniforms
* LB Hasson Reddick started doing individual work as he recovers from a groin injury
* Rookies Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter have been dominating
* DE Derek Barnett agreed to a restructured contract

Rookie defensive picks Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter have been dominant. I think that last sentence is something everyone feared. The Eagles defense was good enough last year and to maybe only get stronger even after some key losses is not a good sign for opponents. In other news the Eagles are bringing back their “Kelly Green” uniforms this year and these may have been the most highly anticipated uniforms. This team has appeared to takea. few more steps forward this offseason!

**Pittsburgh Steelers:**

* Signed LB Kwon Alexander
* Rookie FB Monte Pottebaum retired
* WR George Pickens is looking forward to more deep shots this year
   * Got into it with teammate CB Joey Porter

Not too much news here but good move to sign LB Kwon Alexander and WR George Pickens is looking as dominant as ever at practice but needs to avoid the skirmishes. This team is one to watch to make a big jump.

**San Francisco 49ers:**

* RB room looking really strong early in the year as it always is
* QB Brock Purdy appears to have his arm strength back after early concerns
   * Will need to shake off a bit of rust though as there have been early struggles
* DE Nick Bosa still holding out and no contract yet
* WR Brandon Aiyuk looking like the best player on the team thus far
* Added Frank Gore and Dashon Goldson to coaching staff
* Signed LB Kyahva Tezinio
* Signed CB Terrance Mitchell to a 1-year deal

Most of the news here has been about the 4 QBs all getting a pretty good amount of reps this offseason and really overall none of them looking that good thus far. If there is a list it would probably go Darnold and Purdy tied for 1st with Lance right behind them and Brandon Allen a distant 4th as expected. It has been interesting though because the top 3 have all struggled in different ways but none of them have been good. The thing though that Darnold and Purdy have going for them though is that Purdy has been recovering from surgery and needs some time to shake off the rust and for Darnold it is a new offense. Has Kyle Shanahan given up on Lance or is he about to? If he does, will he be traded soon? All reasonable questions that no one has any idea about. Other notable news is that no deal has gotten done with DE Nick Bosa still and it would be nice to have him practicing by now.

**Seattle Seahawks:**

* RB Kenneth Walker has missed practices and may continue for some time as he deals with a groin issue
* RB Zach Charbonnet got checked by docs for a shoulder injury and is out indefinitely at the moment
* TE Noah Fant passed his physical and activated off PUP list
* RB Kenny McIntosh has been extremely impressive early
* QB Geno Smith turned down the Quarterback show for season 2
* Signed DB Chris Steele
* S Jamal Adams and LB Jordyn Brooks on the PUP list
* Signed LB Uchenna Nwosu to a 3-year $45m extension

Tough week for RBs with the Seahawks because of injuries to Walker and Charbonnet. However, the good news is that they have a lot depth there and everyone has looked really good that they have put at the position. TE Noah Fant was able to pass his physical and get activated off the PUP list. Other notable news was signing LB Uchenna Nwosu to a 3-year $45m extension. Great move by the team to get a key defensive piece locked up and happy.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers:**

* DT Calijah Kancey carted off the field with a right leg injury
* Signed DL William Gholston to a 1-year $2.8m contract
* LB Devin White reported to camp

Not much news from the team but good to hear that LB Devin White did indeed report to camp after some offseason troubles. Still appears that Baker Mayfield will be QB1 and may even have a bit of a career resurgence.

737,There seems to be some revisionist history on Russell Wilson,nfl,"Saw a post asking ""what happened to Russell Wilson"" and saw a lot of comments giving the same tired narratives I've seen before. So I thought I'd chime in as someone who's watched every game of his career in Seattle.

I'll be straight up that I'm 100% a homer, but I won't say I thought Wilson was ever snubbed of MVP or anything like that. He was the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th best option many years, never quite #1. He was very consistent, but his absolute peak was short-lived (2018-early 2020).

Anyways heres the stats of his often overlooked early years. The time where people say he was carried by his defense and run game, when the truth is they were *all* very important pieces to the puzzle.

Russell Wilson's first 4 NFL seasons:

2012: **6th** in EPA/Play, **2nd** in PFF Grade, **3rd** in QBR, **4th** in Passer Rating

2013: **6th** in EPA/Play, **6th** in PFF Grade, **9th** in QBR, **7th** in Passer Rating

2014: **5th** in EPA/Play,  **14th** in PFF Grade, **6th** in QBR, **10th** in Passer Rating

2015: **3rd** in EPA/Play, **6th** in PFF Grade, **4th** in QBR, **1st** in Passer Rating

Edit: Updated his PFF grades. Thanks to DryDefenderRS for providing accurate ones which also include playoffs

**Both Super Bowl performances**:

2013

R. Wilson: **0.548 EPA/Play**  /  P. Manning: **-0.178 EPA/Play**

2014

R. Wilson: **0.237 EPA/Play**  /  T. Brady: **0.257 EPA/Play** (Wilson actually had a higher adjusted EPA/Play)

**From 2012 - 2015, including postseason, Wilson was 3rd in EPA/Play behind only Rodgers and Brady.**

Wilson's efficiency was among these names already in his first 4 years, AKA the years people say he was carried by an elite defense and run game.

He was also **1st** in completion percentage over expected during this time.

Yes the defense and run game were elite and he doesn't win that SB without them. No he wasn't ""carried"". Wilson did more than enough at the most important position.

After that we get into the years where the team lacked talent at many positions, yet the coaching staff and Wilson's play kept them in the playoff picture year after year.

Edit: I also remember a PFF tweet I saw a while back that listed the top graded QBs they've ever graded. I don't remember the exact order but it was essentially:

Brady, Rodgers, Manning, Brees, Mahomes, Wilson. That is ELITE company

I could go on with more examples, but you get the point

**My take:**

Russell Wilson from 2012-2020 was obviously a VERY GOOD QB. No one argues that. But looking back on him career in Seattle, I do wonder how he ever got the perception of being the ""Best"" or ""being elite/top 3"".

From 2012-2014, I think everyone would agree Aaron Rodgers, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady were better. So he is out the top 3 there. Obviously Manning declined and retired, but I still think Rodgers and Brady were considered better from 2015-2020. This isn't even factoring in Brees, Rivers or Matt Ryan, who you could argue for

And looking at Russ statistically, he rarely had the ""ELITE"" numbers. I'm just going to start from 2015 cause before that Russ was Very low volume. He had great passer ratings but he threw the ball 20 times a game and wasn't asked to really sling it.

* 2015 Russ actually led NFL in passer rating. Top 5 in EPA so that was his best year
* 2016 Russ took a step back. Not top 5 in Rating, EPA or ANY/A
* 2017 he led in TD passes, partially due to injuries but he did carry Seahawks with little support. However, his rate stats weren't amazing. I don't think he was top 3 here
* 2018 he had great TD/INT but only had 3440 yards. Mahomes, Brees and Rivers were better imo. I would also argue Luck was a little better
* 2019 Wilson was considered an MVP candidate, but he was 7th in ANY/A. Lamar obviously won MVP and honestly even Mahomes on a 14 game sample was better. ANY/A, EPA etc
* 2020 he began to decline, having a very top heavy year. First 8 weeks he was great but average after
* Then of course injured in 2021 and we know what happened in 2022
* The Seahawks were top 5 in points scored ONCE with Russ. Even the year he was an ""MVP"" candidate, they were 13th in YPD and 11th in PPD.

Russell Wilson to me was always very good without being truly elite. Many teams would have loved to have him, but I do find it strange that he garnered a perception of being elite when he never really was

Expanded upon u/JPAnalyst breakdown of the franchise tag numbers vs the total cap I took it a step farther and reworked the information as a % of the total cap. This clearly shows the devalutation of pay across multiple positions not just the running back position as being in decline. I know I am pretty terrible at graphics so I hope this shows clearly enough. Any where the black line is above the blue line the positional tag has increased as a % of the cap and where it is lower it has decreased as a % of the cap. The green line demonstrating those changes. 

Here is the raw data, it may be easier to digest and also worth nothing the sum of all tags is less as a percentage of cap but I couldnt decide what exactly that meant in terms of the rest of the data. Tag numbers are in millions

779,2023 Offseason Update: Cincinnati Bengals,nfl,"**Cincinnati Bengals**

r/bengals

**AFC North**

**Coaching Changes**: Shockingly? None. The Bengals went into the offseason appearing like they were going to lose both OC Brian Callahan and DC Lou Anarumo to head coaching jobs. Despite both of them going deep into interviews with multiple teams both coaches were retained in Cincinnati for another year. This might be the last year that this coaching tree has all of its limbs remain intact.

**Free Agency**

**Players lost/cut**

|Player|Cut/Traded|New Team|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Jessie Bates|Contract Expired|Atlanta Falcons|
|Vonn Bell|Contract Expired|Carolina Panthers|
|Hayden Hurst|Contract Expired|Carolina Panthers|
|Tre Flowers|Contract Expired|Atlanta Falcons|
|Brandon Allen|Contract Expired|San Francisco 49ers|

|Brandon Wilson|Contract Expired|None|
|Kevin Huber|Contract Expired|Retired|
|Tyron Johnson|Contract Expired|Dallas Cowboys|
|Eli Apple|Contract Expired|Miami Dolphins|

**Major Losses**

**Jessie Bates -** This is obviously the biggest one. Jessie was a cornerstone of the defense that took the Bengals to the Super Bowl just last year. It was relatively well known coming into this season that there was little to no chance Jessie was re-signing with the team once his franchise year was up. Jessie came into his free agency year and performed as you might expect a player who was heading for free agency to play. His overall tackles were down substantially, but he had a career high 4 interceptions and a forced fumble. Hes going to be a loss for this team.

**Vonn Bell -** A member of the Bengals 2020 free agency class Vonn Bell made an immediate impact on the team that reverberated for his entire tenure in Cincinnati. Vonn started throughout the entire Super Bowl run and was off to a roaring start last year with four interceptions and two forced fumbles through 9 games before disaster struck and he was injured. Vonn is an absolute impact player who will be missed by the defense as well.

**Samaje Perine -** Samaje is a player whos impact isnt entirely noticeable on just a cursory glance at the stats. However any further deep dive and you see how good he actually was. With only two starts Samaje amassed 394 rushing yards and 287 receiving yards. He was more than serviceable change of pace back who frankly performed at starter levels at points in the season.

**Hayden Hurst -** Another player whos numbers don't quite tell the whole story. Hurst had 414 yards in the regular season which sounds like ""mid"" tight end numbers, but Hayden was a huge part of the offense. He played in 13 games and had 19 3rd down catches on 22 targets for an average of 7.4 yards per attempt. He also averaged 9.4 yards a catch on 1st down.

**Eli Apple -** Eli was seen as a backup last year and in the end had to take a much larger role in the team. Most assumed between Mike Hilton, Cam Taylor Britt, and Awuzie that Eli would seldom see the field, and boy most were wrong. Eli started 15 games with the Bengals.

**Kevin Huber/Clark Harris -** Well this may be one of those things that people look at and say ""wow you really consider a punter and long snapper major losses?"" Yes. Clark Joined in 2008, and Kevin Joined in 2009 making both guys the last hold outs of the Palmer era.

Clark Harris came into Cincinnati and helped bring stability to a position that frankly had been god awful prior to his arrival. He joined the team and was the long snapper for almost every game from when he joined in 2008 until his unfortunate injury against the Steelers in game one of last year.

Kevin Huber likewise was joined in the Palmer era out of a positional need. He was a draft pick out of the university of Cincinnati and set the record for games played by a Bengal last year at 216.

Both of these guys were invaluable to the franchise through three eras of Bengals football and will be missed.

**Players signed**

&amp;#x200B;

|Player|Position|Signed/Re-signed|Length|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Orlando Brown Jr|LT|Signed|4 Years|
|Germaine Pratt|Linebacker|Re-Signed|3 Years|
|Nick Scott|Safety|Signed|3 Years|
|Joe Bachie|Linebacker|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Jalen Davis|Cornerback|Re-Signed|2 Years|
|Michael Thomas|Safety|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trayveon Williams|Running Back|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trent Taylor|Wide Receiver|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Cody Ford|Offensive Tackle|Signed|1 year|
|Sidney Jones|Cornerback|Signed|1 year|
|Irv Smith Jr|Tight End|Signed|1 year|
|Tarell Bashan|Outside Linebacker|Signed|1 year|
|Drew Sample|Tight End|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trevor Siemian|Quarter Back|Signed|1 year|
|Mitchell Wilcox|Tight End|Re-Signed|1 year|
|Trey Hendrickson|Defensive End|Extended|1 year additional|

This is going to end up being an interesting free agency class. At face value most of the players are either re-signed or depth, however there are definitely going to be some impact players here.

**Orlando Brown Jr –** The biggest signing of the year shores up the left side of the Bengals offensive line for the next 4 years. Its no secret that the Bengals have had issues with the offensive line and have now spent two off seasons attempting to correct this. Orlando Brown Junior was arguably the best LT in free agency this year and the Bengals getting him and sliding Jonah Williams over to the right side was honestly shocking. If Orlando Brown is able to be the game changer the team thinks he is the Bengals offense should be even better.

**Germaine Pratt** – I think if you talked to most Bengals fans prior to free agency they’d have told you there was little chance that Pratt was coming back. To re-sign Pratt for 3 years is shoring up the LB position for the next 3 years and put the team into a better position to keep their defense operating at a high level.

**Nick Scott –** Nick is the immediate answer to replacing Vonn Bell, with the chance of Jordan Battle supplanting him in the future. He’s got big shoes to fill, and had a nice year in 2022 with the Rams with 86 tackles, two interceptions and two forced fumbles, not bad at all for a former 7th round pick.

**Irv Smith Jr –** This years stop on the “Bengals get a tight end a big contract with another team” train is Irv Smith Jr! Irv was drafted in the second round in 2019 by the Minnesota Vikings. He has 88 receptions for 844 yards and 9 touchdowns in his four year career. After what was done with Hayden Hurst last year I fully expect Irv to put up career highs in receptions, touchdowns, and yards, then for him to leave in free agency for 3/20.

**Draft Results**

|Round|Player|Position|School|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Myles Murphy|Edge|Clemson|
|2|DJ Turner|Cornerback|Michigan|
|3|Jordan Battle|Safety|Alabama|
|4|Charlie Jones|Wide Receiver|Purdue|
|5|Chase Brown|Running Back|Illinois|
|6|Andrei Iosivas|Wide Receiver|Princeton|
|6|Brad Robbins|Punter|Michigan|
|7|DJ Ivey|Cornerback|Miami|

I'm going to break these guys down into categories.

**Immediate Contributors:**

**Myles Murphy** \- I fully expect Murphy to have a big role this year. I don't know if he starts at all, and to an extent I don't think he does, but I expect him to get significant playing time at some point this year. One story that has come out in the offseason was from the Bengals strength coach about the fact that Murphy did 20 straight pull ups at his game weight of 280lbs then proceeded to run 20.1mph (GPS tracked).

**DJ Turner** \- With the loss of Eli Apple even with the return of Awuzie I expect second rounder DJ Turner to see significant playing time early. He reportedly ran the fastest 40 yard dash at the combine and should help improve the speed of a group that often felt like it got burned when Apple was targeted.

**Brad Robbins** \- As I mentioned previously the Bengals parted ways with Kevin Huber who has in turn retired. Drue Chrisman took over as the Punter for the Bengals and was serviceable but not what I would call elite. You don't invest a draft pick in a punter unless you think they have real talent. The Bengals have a training camp battle with Chrisman and Robbins for the punter of the future, if Robbins wins out he will be an immediate contributor this year.

**Possible Contributors this year:**

**Jordan Battle** \- With the addition of Nick Scott Battle doesn't have to be an immediate starter and that may be good. It will allow him to ease into the league. Battle has been quiet for the most part this off season but alabama fans rave about him. He could force his way into the starting line up if things fall his way.

**Chase Brown** \- The restructured deal for Mixon means the Bengals aren't necessarily looking for a new lead back right now. When Brown has talked to reporters hes talked about working on his run blocking more than anything else with pass catching short behind it. It sounds like theres a good chance he has already been told to plan on being a 3rd down back early on. If he has a role similar to Perine this year his impact could be massive.

**Maybe next year:**

**Charlie Jones and Andrei Iosivas** \- I wish the best for both of these guys, but honestly I don't understand these picks. No one reading this was muttering ""Wow the bengals need more Wide Receivers"" yet here we are. With Boyd, Chase, and Higgins as well as Mixon, Irv Smith, Trenton Irwin, and Trent Taylor I just don't see these guys getting much of a shot this year. I could be wrong, and if one of them breaks out it might make it easier for the team to move on from Boyd in the off season.

**DJ Ivey** \- I don't expect much this year out of Ivey with Turner drafted ahead of him, however hes gotten praise from CB coach Chuck Burks as being able to play the position ""at a high level"" and has been praised for his 4.46 speed. Speed really seems to be the common denominator with the defensive players in this years draft.

**Other Offseason News that Affected the Team**

Joe Mixon sure had an offseason. He had someone get shot on his property....maybe by his sister? He was arrested for threatening someone with a gun, and of course he signed a new restructured deal for less money.

This has also been the off season of the Burrow and Higgins contract. As of this writing nothing has officially happened on either fronts, but it looks like it might be getting close.

Projected Roster

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Quarterback|Joe Burrow|Trevor Siemian|Jake Browning|
|Runningback|Joe Mixon|Chase Brown|Trayveon Williams/Chris Evans|

|Right Cornerback|Cam Taylor Britt|Mike Hilton|Jalen Davis|

**Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Position groups:**

**QB** – Well previously I would have said this is an elite group just because Joe Burrow is leading it. I still want to believe that but I’d like to hear more about Burrows calf before I go into too much detail on how amazing this group is. Jake Browning has been getting a lot of run from the local press for looking good through the first few days of training camp. I wouldn’t be entirely shocked to see him as the eventual second string QB but for now since he has game experience I expect Trevor to remain in the second string position.

**WR/TE –** I don’t think its much of a stretch to call this the best WR room in the league. When Chase went down for an extended period last year everyone thought this team would fall back because teams would just double team Tee Higgins. Instead not only did Higgins thrive but players like Trenton Irwin stepped up out of nowhere to catch 231 yards in 9 games and only two starts. Add the guys in that were drafted this year and this is a deep deep deep WR corps.

Tight End is not as deep, but the Bengals have spent the last two years taking Tight Ends who had a lot of potential but not yet lived up to it and lifting them to new contracts. I fully expect Irv Smith to have a career year this year.

**RB** – This may be an issue. Joe Mixon had a little over 1200 yards from scrimmage last year, which is down from what this team expects from Mixon, but still a serviceable number. However, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say Chris Evans has been disappointing since he was drafted and Trayveon Williams has not had much chance to shine with only 231 yard in his career. If Chase Brown can come in and make an immediate impact in training camp he can easily take the Samaje position from last year spelling Mixon and possibly taking over as the lead back. This is going to be something to watch going forward as one of the most intriguing training camp battles.

**Offensive Line –** Boy this is going to be an interesting one this year. On Paper the OL is substantially better than it has been the last two years and that’s considering that they were SUBSTANTIALLY better last year than the year before. However, what happened? They had injuries in consecutive weeks losing 3 offensive lineman in 3 weeks. The lineup for this year looks substantially better on paper, but more than anything it looks deeper.

**Defensive Line –** Sam Hubbard, BJ Hill, Trey Hendrickson, and DJ Reader is a nightmare front for any offense. Now add first round pick Myles Murphy and Joseph Ossai into the mix and this is a very strong defensive front four. I’d put this defensive line against most defensive lines in football from a pure talent perspective. The Bengals gave up the third fewest points in the AFC last year and this line is a big part of the reason why.

**Linebacker –** Logan Wilson, Germain Pratt, and Akeem Davis Gaither are all three studs as starters, but the depth doesn’t currently look amazing. This may be one of the few positions the team is thin at. Then again its possible that Lou could work some magic with the second stringers if it comes down to it.

**Secondary –** Awuzie, Britt, Scott, and Hill are all extremely talented looking members of the secondary with a lot of question marks. Awuzie has been incredible for the Bengals but was lost last year to an injury. He just came off the PUP list a few days ago and should be ready to go for the start of the season, but is he ready? Dax Hill and Cam Taylor Britt are both second year players who showed a lot of promise towards the end of last year but you have to put a lot on their shoulders this year. Nick Scott had a nice year with the Ram last year, but this is going to be a big step for him. Last year was his first year as a starter for the Rams in a year where it was apparent really early the Rams weren’t doing much. This year he will be expected to start for a Bengals team that many are picking as Super Bowl contenders. Behind these guys Mike Hilton and Michael Thomas have showed a lot of promise and played extremely well at times and Jordan Battle will have a chance to make his case as a future starter.

**Special Teams** – Special teams is looking stronger this year than it has in a while. Kicker has not been a worry since Evan McPherson was drafted, but unfortunately Punter has been a position of weakness for the last year or two. Drue Chrisman has been okay since he took over for Kevin Huber, but he hasn’t exactly been booming kicks. The drafting of a punter this year makes it appear like the team might be looking for a substantial upgrade in punter. If Brad Robbins takes over as the punter of the future this teams special teams may be fixed for the next few years.

**Schedule Predictions**

**Week 1 – Bengals @  Browns**

Opening up with the Battle for Ohio sure is going to be a show down. This will be a test for a new look Bengals defense that is without Bates or Bell and a once again reworked Bengals OLine against Myles Garrett.  I believe the Bengals offense will overcome the Browns defense.

Final Score Bengals 27- Brown 17.

**Week 2 – Bengals Vs Ravens**

A second AFC North Match up in two weeks is honestly almost a little unfair.  Bengals Ravens has been hard nose football and last season was no exception. The Bengals lost offensive linemen in back to back Ravens games between week 18 and the wildcard round. So the Bengals will hopefully have a substantially healthier offense than the last time they played the Ravens. However the Bengals will not be playing the Pro Bowl QB Tyler Huntley and will instead be playing non Pro Bowl QB Lamar Jackson.  This will be a close tough game.

Final Score 24-17 Bengals.

**Week 3 – Bengals Vs Rams**

This could be a massive matchup for this early in the season. These two teams haven’t faced off in a meaningful game since the Super Bowl. They did however have a joint practice last year and boy howdy did it go swimmingly, as long as you ignore a massive fight that occurred at the end of the second practice that involved La’el Collins taking swings and Aaron Donald swinging Bengals helmets at people. So no theres definitely not any bad blood here.  This will be a big match up that I think the Bengals in particular will be “up for” more than any other game in the first quarter of the season.

Final Score Bengals 31 Rams 17

**Week 4 – Bengals @ Titans**

The Titans appear to be a bit of a mess right now. They don’t have a real receiving threat and its not clear if their QB of the Future is also the QB of the present. Heres what I do know for sure, The Bengals played the Titans last season without Awuzie and without Vonn Bell and still held Derrick Henry to 38 yards on 17 carries and Ryan Tannehill without a TD.  Obviously anything can happen, but this should not be a close game when its all said and done.

Final Score Bengals 24 Titans 10

**Week 5 – Bengals @ Cardinals**

I expect the Cardinals to be a substantially better team this year than last year, I do not expect this to be a competitive game. This early in the season the Cardinals should still be gelling and working to figure out their identity.

Final Score Bengals 35 Cardinals 17

**Week 6 Bengals Vs Seahawks**

The Seahawks are a very good team that on paper should have a lot of continuity from last year. The Seahawks scored a lot of points, but also gave up a lot of points. I don’t see why this would be any different.

Bengals 35 Seahawks 31

Week 7 – Bye Week

**Week 8 – Bengals @ 49ers**

This has all the makings of a trap game. I don’t think the Bengals will exactly take the 49ers lightly, but I can’t help but think that coming off of a bye week and with the Bills the next week this game could be a loss for the Bengals.  The 49ers had a very potent offense post adding CMC last year and I don’t see any reason that changes this year unless Purdy regresses. I think this will be a tough match up that the 49ers will win and once again my childhood being ruined will be brought up by the announcers.

Bengals 13 49ers 20

**Week 9 – Bengals Vs Bills**

In a rematch of last years AFC Divisional round game the Bengals and Bills play a game on a sunday night on NBC that is going to dredge up a lot of memories of Damar Hamlins horrifying injury and  an ill timed whopper commercial. This is going to be an emotional game for both teams and if the Bengals really are going to compete for the 1 seed a game they’ll have to win. The Bengals took the Bills to the wood shed in the divisional round, a loss that the Bills are going to be keen on avenging. This game could go either way, but the Burrow lead bengals havent shied away from the lights when they’ve gotten bright (unless they are playing the brown on halloween) this should be a Bengals win.

Bengals 27 Bills 19

**Week 10 – Bengals Vs Texans**

On paper this shouldn’t be close. The Texans are rolling up with a Rookie QB against a defense that has been very stout in the past and we have no reason to this it won’t be this year as well. Final Score Bengals 38 Texans 10

**Week 11 – Bengals @ Ravens**

The Bengals and Ravens are two very evenly matched teams, last year the Bengals pulled out the last two games, while the Ravens won their first meeting. All 3 games were very close. I gave the Bengals the edge in their opening matchup, but am giving the Ravens the edge here. They have an incredible secondary and I think that wins out at home.

Final Score Ravens 30 Bengals 20

**Week 12 – Bengals Vs Steelers**

This should be a big year for the team from Pittsburgh with them taking a major step forward. The second year for both Pickens and Pickett should be big steps from last year and a step towards them being substantially more competitive.  However I don’t believe that they make that big of a step forward against The Bengals and the revamped Offensive Line in Cincinnati. Final Score Bengals 27 Steelers 17

**Week 13 – Bengals @ Jaguars**

This should be a fun matchup of two very good young QBs who played very tough playoff games last year. In the end I think the Bengals have the better team and that will translate to a win. I am incredibly interested in seeing how Calvin Ridley looks on the Jags this year and think this could be a good game for him.

Final Score Bengals 27 Jaguars 23

**Week 14 – Bengals Vs Colts**

On paper again this shouldn’t be much of a fight. The Colts are a young team that’s rebuilding, however the Colts have often had the Bengals number in a way that is infuriating for a team that’s only 2 hours away. This game should not be close, but it will be.

Final score Bengals 24 Colts 17

**Week 15 – Bengals Vs Vikings**

I’m not sure what to think of this years Vikings team. Axing Dalvin Cook is just a weird look, but the Vikings have been a RB factory for the last decade constantly having very good, high end RBs so by the time week 15 rolls around I could easily see them having a very good RB corp to replace Dalvin. I really don’t have a lot of thoughts on this game other than I believe it goes the Bengals way.

Final Score Bengals 21 Vikings 13

**Week 16 –  Bengals @ Steelers**

Steelers matchups are always rough for the team from Cincinnati. While I think this game will be close in particular because its being played in Pittsburgh, similar to their first game I think this game goes the Bengals way. Final Score Bengals 24 Steelers 20

**Week 17 –  Bengals @ Chiefs**

In a repeat of the 2021 season the Bengals and Chiefs will play in the second to last game of the season. This time it occurs at KC. This game frankly is a toss up to me, much like the last 4 games against the Chiefs have been. Its going to come down to a late touchdown or field goal, but frankly could easily go either way.  I’m going to predict a final score of 30 - 23, which team wins? No idea.

**Week 18 – Bengals Vs Browns**

Once again mirroring the 2021 season the Bengals will face the Browns in the final game. As I’m predicting the Bengals will win the division this will include most of the Bengals starters being rested. Trevor Siemian will start and the Bengals will take a loss to a Browns team starting most if not all of their starters.

Browns 17 Bengals 10

**Season Predictions**

My final record prediction is 14-3 or 13-4 depending on the outcome of the Chiefs game. 2020 Bengals Fan Usidore feels like 2023 Bengals fan Usidore is being ridiculous, but this is a team that was 12-4 last year and one of those losses only came because of absolute fluke play by an emergency long snapper. They are incredibly talented and were basically a hair away from the 1 seed last year (the chiefs and Bills both had 3 losses). They have a very tough schedule ahead of them, including the gauntlet that is the AFC North. If they can come out of this with 3-4 losses this team will be among the more battle tested AFC teams in years.

Assuming they make the playoffs this is a team that should contend for the Super Bowl. Will they? Only time will tell, but I expect this team as its made up to give a run for their money to any other top teams in the AFC. If this team can somehow snag the one seed any team coming into Cincinnati will be in for a top notch atmosphere.

**Training Camp Storyline**

~~The most interesting storyline this training camp is that this is going to be Joe Burrows first real training camp. 2020 was covid, 2021 he was rehabbing from his knee injury, and 2022 he had his appendix removed. So this is going to be his first time entering the season with actual practice under his belt, which will be interesting. Last year it took Joe 4 games to get going post his appendix removal and weight loss. This year it will be interesting to see how quickly he gets up to speed. If he starts game one like he started game five last year the league is in deep trouble.~~

I have no words for this.

Obviously the new storyline for training camp and really the asterisks for everything I’ve written to this point is the health of Joe Burrow. I’ve been traveling for work this week and was in a meeting when I got the text about Burrow being carted off. The person who lead the meeting came up to me afterward and said he couldn’t figure out why I looked distraught out of the blue, then he checked his phone when the meeting ended and figured it out.

All of my predictions, ideas, hopes and dreams for this team this year are riding on Joe Burrows calf being 100% by week 1. If for some reason his current strain puts a strain on the Bengals and Trevor Siemian or Jake Browning end up starting a significant number of early games this all becomes moot and the season becomes substantially harder.

So the new training camp storyline at this point has to be how Trevor and Jake are doing and who is taking first team reps. Currently they are alternating on a day to day basis, it will be interesting to see how long that continues. Taylor has also said they will sign another QB. It will be interesting to see if they go after someone like Jameis Winston who has significant starting experience or someone more along the lines of Trevor Siemian who showed some potential but has never really started.

Either way its obvious that Bengals fans are hoping that Joes calf muscle is rested and ready to go by Week 1 against the Browns on the road.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15dom9n,0.88,False,1690731632.0

801,2023 Off Season Review Series: Los Angeles Chargers,nfl,"# Los Angeles Chargers

10-7 2022 Record  |  2nd in AFC West  |  Lost 30-31 @ Jacksonville in the Wild Card matchup

**Redemption**

This team has to prove they belong in the top tier of AFC teams in this era. They have the talent, and they have the coaching staff. They have keep guys on the field, and close out games that are sure wins. Ever since drafting Justin, its been this team needing one more piece. Going into this season it looks like all the pieces are in place. Sure they may have some weaknesses along the line, might not be deep at running back, linebacker or safety. They have key pieces in the right places to go far this season. This team should do well even in a tough conference. If not the pressure will be on Staley, who has received outside criticism during his tenure as head coach.

# Coaching Changes

**Incoming coaches**

|Coach|Position|
|:-|:-|
|Kellen Moore|Offensive Coordinator|
|Doug Nussmeier|QB coach/ Passing game coordinator|
|Derrick Ansley|Defensive Coordinator|
|Jeff Howard|Linebackers Coach|
|Tom Donatell|Secondary Coach|
|Will Harris|Assistant Secondary Coach|
|Robert Muschamp|Defensive Quality Control coach|
|Sal Lopez|Head Athletic Trainer|
|Marco Zucconi|Director of Player Health and Performance|

Kellen Moore is the huge addition, Lombardi had to go. People may say Lombardi was used a sacrifice for Staley to keep his job, but with this offense you have to get results and it just seemed like something was missing. The hitch route became to common last year, the ball needs to get in the air. This team has to get Keenan and Mike to challenge the top and middle of the field. Quentin will be an amazing player for Herbert to get the ball out quick if this offensive line has injury concerns. Also Ansley gets promoted after Hill is let go, this is also a shuffle that needed to happen. Shake the stink of last years disappointment of and come back with guys that are hungry. Also a new head athletics trainer, Damon Mitchell had been with the team since 2001 and had been the head trainer for 6 years.

# Free Agency

**Players lost/cut**

|Player|Position|New Team|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nasir Adderley|FS|***Retired***|
|Bryce Callahan|CB|*(Free Agent)*|
|Chase Daniel|QB|*(Free Agent)*|
|Richard Rodgers II|TE|*(Free Agent)*|
|Tyeler Davison|DT|*(Free Agent)*|
|DeAndre Carter|WR/KR|Las Vegas|
|Christian Covington|DE|Detroit|
|Troy Reeder|LB|Minnesota|
|Drue Tranquill|LB|Kansas City|
|Kyle Van Noy|LB|Baltimore|
|Breiden Fehoko|DE|Pittsburgh|
|Joe Gaziano|DE|Atlanta|
|Forrest Merrill|DE|Seattle|
|Storm Norton|OT|New Orleans|
|Derrek Tuszka|DE|Minnesota|

Losses Like Adderley, Van Noy and Tranquill hurt, they have tried to replace or upgrade at those positions. We shall see how those changes turn out.  Chase Daniel not being brought back, and replaced with younger guys should be fine as long as Justin stays healthy. Covington being let go after being injured is how it goes, he was a decent stop gap on the interior but it just never came together. Sad to see DeAndre Carter go, but hopefully they wont have to go that deep into the depth chart this year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Players signed**

|Player|Position|Old Team|Length (Years)|Salary (Millions)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Justin Herbert|QB|*Contract Extension*|5|262.5|
|Eric Kendricks|ILB|Minnesota|2|13.25|

|Cameron Dicker|K|***RFA***|1|.705|

|Kemon Hall|CB|***RFA***|1|.940|
|Donald Parham Jr.|TE|***RFA***|2|2.65|
|Foster Sarell|OT|***RFA***|1|.705|

This is a huge year for Herbert, just signed an thru 2029. Chargers needed to lock him down, and doing so before Burrow probably is for the best. Re-signing Pipkins and Fox hold key spots for mid level talent, but they will have to prove they are worth the money. Kendricks brought in to shore up the tackling, hopefully making the defense more effective at all levels. CJ Okoye will be a project, not expecting anything right now. He could be a potential replacement for Mack down the line. Guyton and Parham will be key rotation guys on offense they have real skill and are hopefully going to get a few chances to prove just how good they can be.

# Draft

|Round|Pick Number|Player|Position|School|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|21|Quentin Johnston|WR|TCU|
|2|54|Tuli Tuipulotu|OLB|USC|
|3|85|Daiyan Henley|ILB|Washington State|
|4|125|Derius Davis|WR|TCU|
|5|156|Jordan McFadden|T|Clemson|
|6|200|Scott Matlock|DT|Boise State|
|7|239|Max Duggan|QB|TCU|

This draft is all about making sure they got depth where they may need it should an injury occur. There is a possibility Henley getting looks at starter, it just depends on the coverage they use and how Kenneth Murray Jr. does this season. Tuli will be useful as a pass rusher but with Bosa and Mack he is definitely a back up. Then the group from TCU, Davis will get some looks at receiver but mostly serve as a returner. Max will start the season as the third string QB, he's got time to grow into a decent backup and reliable guy in the room, but the big name is Quentin Johnston. The 21st pick will be placed in a group of talented wide receivers, some say they should have picked a speedster or maybe another position that was more needed. Quentin Johnston has had a good start to camp and will look to silence the critics.

&amp;#x200B;

*Other Offseason News that Affected the Team*

Staley replacing some of his coordinators was a huge move and will have to return results quickly. If he doesn't build wins early in the season he will be on the hot seat. I have him winning 3 out of 4 heading in to the bye week, Miami, Tennessee and Minnesota will be key games in getting of to a good start this season. Joey Bosa has to be on the field, he's a key difference maker, and hopefully the new athletic trainer will be the answer to the injury bug that bit this team last season. After a trade request and a bit of unrest this offseason, Austin Ekeler getting 2M in incentives will shift his focus to meeting those incentives and figuring out a long term solution after the season.

Key Players:

***Justin Herbert***

***Austin Ekeler***

***Keenan Allen***

***Rashawn Slater***

***Joey Bosa***

***Derwin James***

***J.C. Jackson***

I'm highlighting these guys, but instead of talking about them individually, I'll say this. These guys have proven they are stars/superstars, they are all impact players that are incredible. They also improve the players they play with. Above all else they have to stay healthy, or at least the majority of these guys. J.C. being ready for the season is not only miraculous, but also very important for getting the other DBs ready at the position they expect to spend most of the season. Surely I could add Linsley, Mack or Kendricks to this group, they are also incredible players themselves. Three proven veterans that will all be able to significantly impact games, but the first group needs to be the difference makers.

# Position Group Summary

*Position groups:*

* *QB -* Top of the league talent. Certainly a cannon for an arm, and he needs to let it fly this year.
* *Backfield -* Ekeler and the boys will hope to be better than last year running the ball.
* *OL -* Hopefully a healthy line will give better results in the run game, and give Justin time to throw.
* *Pass catchers -* a talented group that needs to get the ball at every level of the field.
* *DL -* strong at the edges but they will have to be good up front and stop the run.
* *LB -* Kendricks will have to prove that he is the answer. If he can be a solid tackler, that solves a lot of problems
* *Secondary -* A group with a lot of promise, we may see 5 or 6 DBs on the field a lot this season.
* *Special Teams -* Gonna have to hit some clutch field goals if the games stay close. New returners may be shakey and have some fumbles early on.

# Key Games

**Miami** has to be a tough game. A home opener but looking just at the offensive fire power, we shall see what the defense is made of. Disguising coverages, holding back the big passing plays have been the key points for Staley. I think they battle it out, close game, but a defeat.

As for **Las Vegas**, both games will be very important, both teams have high hopes. I have to think the Raiders are in over their head again this year. The matchup of Crosby and Slater if both are healthy will be the one to watch. I'm picking two wins but its the AFC west, going 4-2 is going to be a huge point of pride.

This is a huge year for **Dallas**. This will be the Kellen Moore game, he is going to be out to prove a point. Both teams are looking for deep playoff runs, and honestly it could be a win. I'm going to mark it as a loss, if Pollard is in and healthy, we know the run defense is a huge struggle. Until they can prove they are able to stop the run, I'm hesitant to give them the edge.

**Kansas City**, it goes without saying, they are the top of the conference, let alone the division. If the Chargers can pick a game off them it would be huge. Really interested to see how this defense tries to stop Mahomes. Going to be two tough games, but if the Chiefs dominate early throughout the season then the week 18 matchup might be an easy win.

With the **Jets**, it comes down to 1 thing is Aaron Rodgers still at the top of his game. If he is hurt or even out this defense has a good chance of completely stopping any movement by this offense. A huge Monday night win in week 9 would be a great way to set the table for the second half of the season.

**Denver**, we really don't know what's going to happen here. I am very low on the Broncos, I don't think Payton and Wilson will mesh. They have a really solid defense, but on offense they couldn't stop turning over the ball. They committed the 7th most turnovers last year. If that continues, the Chargers defense should dominate those games.

A late December matchup with **Buffalo** will be a great game, and it being at home gives this team a chance. Buffalo has had some crazy weather games in the last few seasons, but that should be the case in LA. Josh Allen coming off an injury that didn't require surgery could be something to watch, especially for a QB who plays as physical as him. I have the Bills roster being one of the best from top to bottom in the AFC. This could be a game of who has a healthier team, or who wants to save some guys for the postseason. Regardless the Bills are always a tough opponent and this will most likely end in a loss.

# Summary

Overall I have the team going somewhere similar to last year, right around 10-7. If the injury bug bites this team again, I don't know if they manage the record they had last year with this schedule. Obviously the last 2 quarters of last season can't happen again. As with any team it comes down to minimizing mistakes, and being in control of the game. They could make a run on the playoffs, but obviously looking at the road through the AFC, it will NOT be easy. This team could take a game off a lot of the top teams. Of course in my game picks, I picked them to lose a lot of the tough matchups. I think a lot of those will be close and honestly could go either way. Ill predict a 31-27 loss to the Chiefs in the AFC conference Championship.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15cvihi,0.83,False,1690645704.0

The worst lifetime W-L percentage opponent for the 2023 season is against the Seattle Seahawks against whom the Eagles have a 0.368 win percentage.

The best lifetime W-L percentage opponent for the 2020 season is against the New York Jets, against whom the eagles have a whopping 1.000 win percentage. The Eagles have played the Jets 12 times and never lost. (The Jets did beat the Eagles in a pre-season game last year.)

There are seven teams that the Eagles played last year, that they also play this year, three of them obviously being division rivals, which they played twice each. The Eagles combined win percentage against those opponents last year was 0.727.

Using the results from the most recent time the Eagles played each team on the 2023 schedule, the Eagles have a 0.429 win percentage.

The most recent 2023 opponent that the Eagles have played was the Chiefs on February 12, 2023, resulting in a loss.

The least recent 2023 opponent that the Eagles have played was the Bills on October 27, 2019, resulting in a win.

881,2023 Offseason Review: Baltimore Ravens,nfl,"**Team: Baltimore Ravens**

Division: AFC North

Subreddit: [r/ravens](https://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/)

2022-23 Regular Season Record: 10-7, 5-3 Home and 5-4 Away, 2nd Place in the AFC North

Postseason: 6th seed, lost to Bengals in Wildcard Round

**Introduction:**

Hello Ravens Flock! Welcome to your 2023 offseason review! I am not a Ravens fan myself (I have the misfortune of being a Bears fan and have no connection to the Ravens or the Baltimore area), so expect a hopefully fair and unbiased examination at the moves the Ravens made this offseason and how this new season looks to be shaping up.

All in all, the 2022-23 season for the Baltimore Ravens was not too bad. Improving from a record of 8-9 the previous season, the team’s 10-7 record was enough to earn a spot in the wildcard round. While the Ravens suffered a first-round exit to their division rivals, the team put up a pretty good fight and had the misfortune of being on the wrong side of a historic fumble return touchdown. The majority of the Raven’s key pieces are returning this year, and combined with some new additions, this team looks to be a serious contender in the AFC once again.

For the past couple years, a crucial problem for the Ravens has been injuries. Key offensive players like Lamar Jackson, J.K. Dobbins, and Rashod Bateman all missed significant time in the 2022-23 season, and the team lost 3 out of their last 4 games, sliding from 9-4 and the 3rd seed in the AFC to 10-7 and the 6th seed. As the new season approaches, hopes of the Ravens making a serious playoff run and having a potential shot at the Super Bowl certainly ride on maintaining the health of their stars.

**Coaching Changes:**

It will be John Harbaugh’s 16th season at the helm, as he looks to bring another Super Bowl to Charm City. Underneath him, though, there have been some changes in leadership.

**Todd Monken - Offensive Coordinator**

The Baltimore Ravens parted ways with their former offensive coordinator Greg Roman in January and hired Todd Monken around a month later. Monken was formerly the offensive coordinator of the University of Georgia, where he helped the Bulldogs win two national championships. Before that, Monken was with the Browns in 2019 (during Odell Beckham Jr.’s most recent 1000-yard receiving season!), the Buccaneers from 2016-18, and head coach of Southern Mississippi from 2013-15. His background is mostly in the receiving room, marking a fresh change from his predecessor’s run-heavy playstyle. For a team that only managed 3040 total passing yards last season (28th in the league), this new hire will ideally open up the passing game and create new opportunities for Lamar Jackson and his receivers to move the ball downfield and score touchdowns. My grade: **A**

**Tee Martin - Quarterbacks Coach**

Promoted from his role as wide receivers coach with the Ravens, Martin has been with the team already for 2 years. Beforehand, he had roles with University of Tennessee, USC, and Kentucky. He replaced quarterbacks coach James Urban. Under Martin’s wide receivers coaching tenure, he didn’t have a lot of superstar talent to work with, and his receivers often struggled to even stay on the field due to injuries. He lacks professional quarterback-coaching experience at the NFL level, but his experience with the Ravens so far has evidently meant that they believe he is ready for the task. My grade: **B**

**Willie Taggart - Running Backs Coach**

His first season at the NFL level, Taggart has previously held roles as head coach of Florida State, Oregon, and most recently Florida Atlantic University from 2020-22. Under his helm, FAU was ranked 38th in rushing yards per game with 184.3 yards. His overall experience at the college level has been mixed, with FAU firing him after an overtime loss to his alma mater, Western Kentucky, in 2022. Before that, he led Florida State to their first losing season in 40 years, then was fired before the end of the next season. Despite this, Harbaugh has confidence in Taggart’s abilities. Hopefully, he is able to lead the Ravens running backs to success this upcoming season. My grade: **C-**

**Greg Lewis - Wide Receivers Coach**

Lewis replaces Tee Martin as wide receivers coach. Before, he was coach of the Chiefs’ running backs and wide receivers from 2017-22. The Chiefs have had significant success during that time, and Lewis will ideally bring that success with him to Baltimore. Over the years, Lewis has guided the development of players like Tyreek Hill, Isiah Pacheco, Mecole Hardman, Brandin Cooks, and Tyler Boyd. He will look to provide that same mentoring to young receivers like Zay Flowers in the Ravens receiving room. My grade: **A**

**Chuck Smith - Outside Linebackers Coach**

Smith was a 2nd-team All-Pro pass rusher with the Falcons in the 1990s, and he once even had a 5-sack game (one of only 19 players to ever do so). He has not coached in the NFL, however, since a pass-rush specialist stint in 2009 with the Jets. The majority of his coaching experience has been as a private pass-rush trainer, where his trainees have included Aaron Donald and Carlos Dunlap. Replacing Rob Leonard, Smith will look to build on the 48 team sacks recorded last season (5th in the NFL). My grade: **B+**

**Dennard Wilson - Defensive Backs Coach**

Wilson helped coach the Eagles’ defensive backs in 2021 and 2022, working with players like Darius Slay, and James Bradberry. Before that, he worked with the defensive backs room on the Jets from 2017-2020. The strength of the Eagles’ secondary in the past two years gives Wilson credibility as he enters a defensive backfield that gave up 229.4 passing yards per game (23rd in the league) and caught 14 interceptions (16th in the league). My grade: **A-**

**Scott Elliott - Strength and Conditioning Coordinator**

The previous strength and conditioning coordinator, Steve Saunders, was a controversial figure for both fans and Ravens players. He was criticized for the team’s high number of injuries by players like Matthew Judon, Derek Wolfe, and Rashod Bateman. Scott Elliott’s promotion to head strength and conditioning coordinator will hopefully mark a new era of fewer injuries, allowing the Ravens to succeed in the later stretch of the season and into the postseason. Before his tenure with the Ravens started in 2018, Elliott ran a training performance facility in Kansas. Elliott must focus on injury prevention and recovery in his new role. My grade: **A-**

**Major Departures:**

**Calais Campbell**: Campbell has been around the league for a while—he’s actually the oldest active defensive lineman in the NFL at 36 years old. He signed with the Ravens in 2020 and has been a solid veteran player on the line, recording 5.5 sacks and 2 forced fumbles in 2022. Unfortunately, though, Campbell was a casualty of the Lamar Jackson payday, and was sacrificed for $7 million in freed cap space. On the Ravens, Campbell was a solid piece of the defense. His veteran presence and good sportsmanship (he won the 2019 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award) will be welcome in Atlanta.

**Ben Powers**: Powers had a breakout season in 2022, notching elite pass block and run block win rates. When it came time for free agency, the Broncos offered him $52 million for 4 years, $28.5 million of the total sum guaranteed. This price was evidently incompatible with a new Lamar Jackson contract and other signings. Whether Powers can continue to perform at a high level is now Denver’s problem. But losing Powers will be a sting to the capabilities of the Ravens’ offensive line.

**Marcus Peters**: A three-time Pro Bowler, Peters has 32 career interceptions—but only one of those came from 2022. Last season was a clear down year after a season-ending ACL injury in 2021. The Raiders have been in need of cornerback improvement, and they signed Peters for that role, hoping he can return to Pro Bowl form. As for the Ravens, the impact of a loss of a veteran pass defender will have to be determined during this upcoming season.

**Major Signings:**

**Lamar Jackson:** The road to re-signing was a rocky one for Lamar Jackson. He first tweeted that he asked for a trade, but received a notably lackluster amount of interest from other teams. Perhaps it was the MVP-winning quarterback’s unprecedented price tag—a record-setting $52 million per year deal ended up happening, including $185 million total guaranteed.Or his history of injuries, as he has missed the end of the last 2 seasons due to various sprains. Jackson does not have an agent and represented himself throughout the dealings, which also may have contributed to some of the chaos throughout contract negotiations. After all is said and done, though, Lamar Jackson will now be making the most money of any player in the NFL, and not a cent will be going to any unnecessary middlemen.

Will the dealings have fractured the connection between Jackson and the Ravens front office? Only time will tell. Is the new deal going to bring Jackson back to his fully-healthy 2019 MVP form? Again, we will have to see. What will Jackson do with all of his new money? Likely upgrade from his paltry $1.3 million mansion and meager Rolls-Royce into something half-decent.

All in all, this deal cements Jackson as the man the Ravens have put their faith in to lead them to victory. Expectations are high. Whether Jackson can stay healthy and prove that he was a worthwhile investment will be key to this upcoming season. My grade: **A-**

**Odell Beckham Jr.:** The Ravens’ 2022 wide receiving corps was headlined by the likes of mostly-injured-Rashod Bateman, Demarcus Robinson, and Devin Duvernay. Beckham Jr. is an instant boost to this receiving room. A 3-time Pro Bowler from 2014-2016, Beckham Jr. has struggled with injuries, and at 30, his time in the NFL may be catching up to him. At the same time, though, Beckham’s athleticism and skills are undeniable when healthy. Pairing him with Lamar Jackson will bring out the best in both of them. My grade: **A-**

**Rock Ya-Sin:** Rock Ya-Sin is 26 years old and has had decent seasons with the Colts and most recently the Raiders. He will compete for and is expected to win the starting outside cornerback slot opposite Marlon Humphrey. After the Ravens did not select a cornerback until the 5th round of the draft, Ya-Sin will likely be a competent but not especially amazing piece of a secondary that needs more depth, especially after the loss of Marcus Peters. My grade: **B**

**Draft:**

|Round|Number|Player|Position|School|

:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|

|1|22|Zay Flowers|WR|Boston College|

|3|86|Trenton Simpson|ILB|Clemson|

|4|124|Tavius Robinson|OLB|Ole Miss|

|5|157|Kyu Blu Kelly|CB|Stanford|

|6|199|Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu|OT|Oregon|

|7|229|Andrew Vorhees|OG|USC|

**Zay Flowers:** Zay Flowers is an explosive, speedy receiver who will likely start in the slot for Baltimore. At Boston College, he was a quick and savvy route runner who racked up high yards after catch too. Flowers’ weakness is that he is undersized and may lack the size to come up with 50-50 or deep balls. He also struggled a bit with drops in college. Flowers’ best usage in the Ravens offense is probably running short or medium crossing routes that get him in the middle of the field where he can use his speed and field vision. This Ravens offense needed explosiveness in the receiving room, and Flowers will instantly provide that, even if he lacks the catching capabilities of other receivers. My grade: **A**

**Trenton Simpson:** Coming into the draft, Trenton Simpson was one of the top-ranked inside linebackers and a definite steal in the third round. However, the Ravens already have a top young inside-linebacker corps with Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen. Notably, the Ravens did decline Patrick Queen’s fifth-year option, so Simpson could be stepping into the starting spot sooner than many may think. At Clemson, Simpson has had experience lining up as an outside linebacker and even a cornerback. He has excellent man-coverage ability and run-defense capabilities, but still may lack the polished technical skills needed for tackling at the Pro-Bowl level. Although this pick was certainly high-value in the third round, it’s unclear what Simpson’s role will be in Baltimore. My grade: **B**

**Tavius Robinson:** Baltimore’s edge rushing has been a point of turnover in the past years—their two projected starters have a combined 3 years of NFL experience, and it appears that veterans Justin Houston and Jason Pierre-Paul have no sign of returning to the Ravens next year. Tavius Robinson is a flashy and physical pass-rusher with excellent athleticism and a lot of potential. He will likely begin his NFL career as a rotational player for the Raven’s pass-rushing team. My grade: **A-**

**Kyu Blu Kelly:** Kyu Blu Kelly not only has a cool name, but a family history of NFL success, as his father Brian was a cornerback for the Buccaneers when they won their first Super Bowl. Last season the cornerback depth behind star Marlon Humphrey was a weakness, and Kelly is a physical and quick cornerback who excels in press coverage situations. However, Kelly is still rough around the edges in zone coverage and as a tackler. He has a lot of potential and will hopefully rise to the occasion for the Ravens. My grade: **A-**

**Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu:** Like many other late-round offensive line prospects, Aumavae-Laula has excellent physical tools but unrefined technique. He will provide depth to an already-adept Ravens offensive line and could develop his skills to gain a starting job later in the future. My grade: **B**

**Andrew Vorhees:** Andrew Vorhees tore his ACL at the NFL combine, essentially ruling him out for the 2023 season, but the Ravens still traded a 2024 6th-round draft pick to the Cleveland Browns to move up and select him. Vorhees is probably what you think of when imaging the physicality of an NFL lineman: strong, powerful, and aggressive. He actually benched the most reps at the combine even after tearing his ACL. This pick was low-risk, high-potential, and while Vorhees won’t be on the field this season, he may play a big role in the future of the Ravens’ O-Line. My grade: **A**

**Position Groups:**

**Quarterbacks:** Lamar Jackson, when healthy, is a top quarterback in the NFL. His MVP-winning season was a demonstration of his abilities in the air and on the ground, and with a new contract signed, perhaps he can return to that form for the entirety of a season (and postseason). However, the last couple of years have been marred by injury, both to Jackson and his supporting cast. Speaking of supporting cast, Jackson’s receiving room last year also did not provide him much support in the throwing game. This season, with new weapons, will be a test for Jackson. Can he stay healthy? Can he lead his team to the playoffs and beyond? Behind him, Tyler Huntley has the distinction of technically being a Pro Bowl QB. His play was solid, but not particularly exceptional, during last season. If Jackson has to sit out a game or two, then Huntley is a capable substitute. However, leaving him at the reins for the majority of a season/playoff push is questionable. My position group grade: **A-**

**Backfield:** J.K. Dobbins is an effective running back when healthy, but persistent injury problems were an issue in 2022. Like much of the rest of this Ravens offense, staying injury-free is a priority for him. Gus Edwards also had a solid 2022 season as a second-string running back but probably won’t turn into a superstar in 2023. Behind the two of them, Justice Hill and Melvin Gordon will vie for snaps and both will serve as decent backups. Fullback Patrick Ricard was selected to the Pro Bowl for the fourth year in a row in 2022, and serves his role well as a gadget-guy able to block, run, and receive. Not to mention, while Lamar Jackson is not officially part of the running back room, his skills on the ground are a huge part of the Raven’s rushing attack. Overall, this backfield has good depth and can be very effective if Dobbins stays healthy, but that might be a big *if*. My grade: **B**

**Receivers:** Last year, the Ravens were bottom-five in receiving yards, and the wide receivers were an especially weak point. Over the offseason, though, the Ravens have made some promising moves, namely signing Odell Beckham Jr. and drafting Zay Flowers. Rashod Bateman also had a promising beginning to the season before missing the majority of 2022 with a foot injury. It will—and I know it is starting to sound like a broken record at this point—all come down to injury. Beckham Jr. has dealt with his own share of injury troubles outside of the Ravens organization and there is no guarantee that Bateman will be able to replicate his flaming-hot start of last season. As for Flowers, all indications point to success in training camp and beyond, but the Ravens have yet to ever draft a Pro Bowl receiver. Can Flowers break the curse? Beyond those three, the starting receivers for much of last season will now become the backups, a role where they will probably be more relatively effective. Toss in Mark Andrews and this group instantly goes up a notch. Isaiah Likely also proved to be a good second option at tight end. My grade: **B+**

**Offensive Line:** While lacking a singular superstar lineman or 2022 Pro Bowler, the Ravens offensive line is altogether a top unit in the NFL. Last season, it proved to be incredibly efficient in the run-blocking and pass-blocking game. Of course, it doesn’t hurt the sack rate when the elusive Lamar Jackson is under center, but still this line has excellent players like Ronnie Stanley, Morgan Moses, Kevin Zeitler, and 2022 All-Rookie center Tyler Lindenbaum. As long as this unit can stay mostly healthy, they should once again be amongst the best in the league. My grade: **A**

**Defensive Line:** Last year, the Ravens defense was top-three against the run and had 48 sacks. However, this could be more attributed to the strength of the teams’ linebackers as well as the defensive scheme and coaching. Michael Pierce’s nose tackle position is able to force double teams and allow for fellow defensive ends Justin Madubuike or Broderick Washington to apply pressure. On paper, this squad doesn’t seem like the most formidable, but if they were effective in 2022, why not in 2023? My grade: **B-**

**Linebackers:** The aforementioned Ravens defense’s effectiveness was primarily due to the powerful duo of Pro Bowler Roquan Smith, who was traded from Chicago to Baltimore in the middle of the 2022 season, and Patrick Queen. Adding rookie Trenton Simpson could add even more depth and athleticism. Odafe Oweh and David Ojabo have not proven much yet, but both are still young and could breakout into edge-rushing talents. Roquan Smith is a proficient tackler and playmaker, and Patrick Queen is also a very reliable tackler. This linebacker corps is certainly top-of-the-league and could be a big factor in the success of the 2023 season. My grade: **A**

**Defensive Backs:** Pro Bowler Marlon Humphrey had a strong season in 2022 with 3 interceptions and the top man coverage grade among cornerbacks. Opposite him, there is a notable lack of depth at corner, however. Rock Ya-Sin will have to replace Marcus Peters, and Kyu Blu Kelly could shine as a rookie. The safeties in Baltimore are a highlight of the whole team. Kyle Hamilton was top-ranked at safety, and although he primarily played in the slot in 2022, his move to strong safety for next season looks very promising. At free safety, Marcus Williams is a great ballhawk with excellent physical traits. This secondary did struggle against the passing game in the 2022 season, allowing the 23rd-most passing yards per game. However, as Kyle Hamilton grows and if a rookie or young player can break out, this could easily become a top unit in the league and have the stats to show for it. My grade: **A-**

**Special Teams:** J-Tuck, Legatron, Justin Tuck-GOAT. . . whatever you want to call him, he’s still the best kicker in the NFL. An incredibly valuable and reliable part of the team, Tucker has often singlehandedly willed his team to victory through his mastery of the art of the field goal. As for punting, while Jordan Stout is still young, he does have a bottom-tier average punt distance. On the other side of special teams, Pro Bowl kick retuner Devin Duvernay scored a kick return touchdown last season and, as long as he stays healthy, threatens to do so again this year. My grade: **A**

**Schedule Prediction:**

Preseason: Three more wins to extend the streak to 26!

|16|@ 49ers|LOSE|10-5|

|17|vs. Dolphins|WIN|11-5|

|18|vs. Steelers|LOSE|11-6|

Explanations:

1. Ravens are 10-2 vs. Texans all time, have a better roster, and are at home.
2. Joe Burrow has never lost at home against the Ravens, and the Bengals are good.
3. The Colts’s strength in running will be neutralized, and their passing attack is questionable
4. Lamar Jackson has won 5 of his last 6 games against the Browns.
5. But he has lost 3 out of his last 4 games against the Steelers.
6. Is the Ravens-Titans rivalry really legit? Also, this is a London game!
7. Baltimore has never lost a home game to Detroit.
8. I predict at this point in the season the Cardinals will already have created their Caleb Williams’ uniform.
9. The Seahawks have an excellent pass offense and defense.
10. Cleveland hasn’t won a game in Baltimore since 2019
11. Home game, playoff revenge against the Bengals. . . who knows?
12. The two most injury-riddled teams square off. Last time, the Ravens dominated in Los Angeles. 
13. A late bye week is a trend towards Super Bowl success.
14. The city of Los Angeles is no match for a post-bye-week Ravens squad.
15. Fun fact: in the 90s, the Jaguars went 8-0 against the Ravens.
16. Remember when the lights went out at the Super Bowl? Good times.
17. In 3 games from 2016-19, the Ravens beat the Dolphins by a combined score of 137-16
18. Sorry Ravens Flock. But I feel like it will be that 8-8 point in the season for Mike Tomlin and he will sell his soul to the devil for another non-losing season.

Final Record: 11-6, 7-2 at home, 4-4 on the road

Postseason: After a predicted record of 11-6, the Ravens would earn a wildcard spot in the playoffs. I predict them to finish second in the AFC North behind the Bengals. As for the playoffs, I think that if the Ravens are still healthy enough by the end of 18 weeks,  the Super Bowl is not at all out of the question. Realistically, though, I foresee this team losing in either the wildcard or divisional round. But Baltimore is certainly a contender in every game they will play this year, and they have the roster to go all the way.",t5_2qmg3,t3_15cf2u5,0.81,False,1690593538.0

* Burrow and the offense tied it at 20-20
* Bengals defense forced punt from Chiefs

Burrow threw a bad pick to Higgins. Don't give me ""arm punt"". It was 3rd and 3. Not 3rd and 20. You want a first down

And then Defense forced ANOTHER Punt

Burrow had the ball at his own 36 with a minute left. All you need is 25 more yards for a field goal. They even had timeouts

* 2 yard pass
* Incomplete
* Sack

And people want to say the game was rigged. If it was rigged for the Chiefs WHY did they have Bengals with ball and chance to get FG with 1 minute left. Doesn't sound like rigged to me. Burrow put up a 70 passer rating.

Even the Ravens and Titans games that they won Burrow was not great in. The Defense made the big plays with the Huntley fumble 6 and picking off Tannehill

Burrow is a very good QB but his perception doesn't match his production, especially in ""Big games""

914,Do Rookie Contract QBs have more playoff success than Veteran Contract QBs (some data),nfl,"Since rookie contracts changed in 2011, ~39.58% of NFL teams started a QB on a rookie contract for the majority of the season. So if the QB on a rookie contract strategy of playoff success were best, we’d expect to see these teams outperform teams that have quarterbacks on veteran contracts and make up greater than 39.58% of playoff berths, 1 seeds, Super Bowl appearances, and or Super Bowl wins. 

Since 2011, they tend to underperform this marker. QBs on a rookie contract make up…

* 32.14% of playoff appearances
* 29.17% of 1 seeds 
* 33.33% of Super Bowl appearances (8 times (~1-2 fewer than an expected 9-10)and ~30.4% below expected appearances)
* 16.67% of Super Bowl wins (twice: Mahomes and Russell Wilson (see below about tricky Wentz, 25% with Wentz) 2-3 fewer than an expected 4-5 so 50-60% below the expected number of wins)

If we were to throw out the rookie year of all these QBs starting on a rookie contract (assuming that teams are hoping to take most advantage of that contract year 2-5, rebuilding in year 1) the percentage of teams is reduced from 39.58% to 34%. So even if we throw rookie QBs out of the league count but include their playoff appearances, this gives us the 32.17% slightly underperforming. If we threw out rookie playoff appearances since we threw out rookie seasons, it would go to ~27%. And 1 seed, Super Bowl appearances, and Super Bowl wins all remain the same but still underperform, though not significantly, the now 34%.

Some other fun data points after looking at the ranking of playoff teams cap hit on QBs since 2011(1=highest cap hit on QB, etc), 

* ~25% of playoff teams' QB cap hit rank is 1-6(1Q), the middle ~50% is 7-21 (IQR) and the last ~25% is 22-32 (thus a skew toward spending more) 
* The mean cap hit rank of playoff teams was 15.14 (with 12 playoff teams, the highest possible is 6.5 and lowest is 26.5). The median is 14. 
* For 1 seeds, the mean is 12 with a median is 12. 
* For Super Bowl participants, the mean is 15.79 with a median of 13.5. 
* For Super Bowl winners, the mean is 12.9, the median is 14. 
* Highest percentage of the cap taken up by the QB position while winning a Super Bowl is the Rams with 23.6% of the cap. Highest percentage of the cap to a single QB is Mahomes with 17.19%
* This last year we see the best year for rookie contract QBs by far. Much better than any other year, they represent 43.75% of starters yet make up 57.14% of playoff participants. One of only 3 years (out of 12) they’ve outperformed veteran contract QBs.

**My take:** Obviously not paying a lot for an expensive position is a huge advantage if that QB is capable of taking the team to a super bowl given the right pieces. That's just common sense and no data changes that. The last fun fact about this last year being very successful for rookie contract QBs could be a trend into the future that the league has figured out how to take advantage of that window. 

Also Tom Brady took less money. He didn't take rookie QB money and he's only 1 data points of 14 playoff participants each year. Who's to say a rookie contract QB wins the super bowl 4 times if he takes 5-10 mill more each year. Rodgers just took a paycut, mahomes is going to be underpaid, so I don't think he skews the data insanely and invalidates all the data but something to take into account for sure. 

Obviously anomalies in the data mean this isn't straightforward and the data either way isn't that conclusive. I think regardless, the data does tell us that drafting a QB capable of taking a team to the super bowl is rare enough that veteran contract QBs are just as valid of a strategy to winning a super bowl. And the hailing of the rookie contract as the ultimate strategy people have proclaimed it to be is a bit exaggerated. In all categories (playoff appearances, 1 seeds, Super Bowl appearances, Super Bowl wins) that strategy seems to have a lower to significantly lower rate of success compared to QBs on veteran contracts. So while it's a great strategy, show some love for your veteran QB and don't throw him away just yet.

946,'You ever look at a ninja?': The untold stories of Browns Hall of Famer Joe Thomas,nfl,"&gt;Over 11 seasons at left tackle for the Cleveland Browns -- from his rookie debut to his final game in 2017 -- Thomas played 10,363 consecutive snaps, believed to be an NFL record.

&gt;""He always wore the baggiest game pants,"" said Browns All-Pro left guard Joel Bitonio, who played four seasons next to Thomas. ""Everybody in the locker room is like, 'What are you wearing? You have no swag.' And finally he told me, 'You ever look at a ninja? Are their clothes tight?' He thought tight pants constricted him. So he had a method to his madness.""

&gt;That included spritzing the inside of his cleats with the pre-tape spray otherwise reserved for ankles.

&gt;""I was pulling to the left and had planted my foot and my foot slipped within my shoe,"" Thomas recalled. ""I couldn't tie my shoes any tighter. The cleats didn't slip, so nobody would've noticed. But I felt my feet slip just a millimeter in my shoe and it caused me to be slow to react to a linebacker that was running underneath. I said, 'I'll never let that happen again.'""",t5_2qmg3,t3_15c0h6z,0.67,False,1690557829.0
